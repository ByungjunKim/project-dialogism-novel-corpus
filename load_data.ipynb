       "'CHAPTER I\\nDU C?T? DE CHEZ BEAVER\\n\\n\\n\"Was anyone hurt?\"\\n\\n\"No one, I am thankful to say,\" said Mrs Beaver, \"except two housemaids\\nwho lost their heads and jumped through a glass roof into the paved\\ncourt. They were in no danger. The fire never reached the bedrooms, I am\\nafraid. Still, they are bound to need doing up, everything black with\\nsmoke and drenched in water and luckily they had that old-fashioned sort\\nof extinguisher that ruins _everything_. One really cannot complain. The\\nchief rooms were _completely_ gutted and everything was insured. Sylvia\\nNewport knows the people. I must get on to them this morning before that\\nghoul Mrs Shutter snaps them up.\"\\n\\nMrs Beaver stood with her back to the fire, eating her morning yoghourt.\\nShe held the carton close under her chin and gobbled with a spoon.\\n\\n\"Heavens, how nasty this stuff is. I wish you\\'d take to it, John. You\\'re\\nlooking so tired lately. I don\\'t know how I should get through my day\\nwithout it.\"\\n\\n\"But, mumsy, I haven\\'t as much to do as you have.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, my son.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nJohn Beaver lived with his mother at the house in Sussex Gardens where\\nthey had moved after his father\\'s death. There was little in it to\\nsuggest the austerely elegant interiors which Mrs Beaver planned for her\\ncustomers. It was crowded with the unsaleable furniture of two larger\\nhouses, without pretension to any period, least of all to the present.\\nThe best pieces and those which had sentimental interest for Mrs Beaver\\nwere in the L-shaped drawing-room upstairs.\\n\\nBeaver had a dark little sitting-room (on the ground floor, behind the\\ndining-room) and his own telephone. The elderly parlourmaid looked after\\nhis clothes. She also dusted, polished and maintained in symmetrical\\norder on his dressing table and on the top of his chest of drawers the\\ncollection of sombre and bulky objects that had stood in his father\\'s\\ndressing-room; indestructible presents for his wedding and twenty-first\\nbirthday, ivory, brass bound, covered in pigskin, crested and gold\\nmounted, suggestive of expensive Edwardian masculinity--racing flasks\\nand hunting flasks, cigar cases, tobacco jars, jockeys, elaborate\\nmeerschaum pipes, buttonhooks and hat brushes.\\n\\nThere were four servants, all female and all, save one, elderly.\\n\\nWhen anyone asked Beaver why he stayed there instead of setting up on\\nhis own, he sometimes said that he thought his mother liked having him\\nthere (in spite of her business she was lonely); sometimes that it saved\\nhim at least five pounds a week.\\n\\nHis total income varied around six pounds a week, so this was an\\nimportant saving.\\n\\nHe was twenty-five years old. From leaving Oxford until the beginning of\\nthe slump he had worked in an advertising agency. Since then no one had\\nbeen able to find anything for him to do. So he got up late and sat near\\nhis telephone most of the day, hoping to be rung up.\\n\\nWhenever it was possible, Mrs Beaver took an hour off in the middle of\\nthe morning. She was always at her shop punctually at nine, and by\\nhalf-past eleven she needed a break. Then, if no important customer was\\nimminent, she would get into her two-seater and drive home to Sussex\\nGardens. Beaver was usually dressed by then and she had grown to value\\ntheir morning interchange of gossip.\\n\\n\"What was your evening?\"\\n\\n\"Audrey rang up at eight and asked me to dinner. Ten of us at the\\nEmbassy, rather dreary. Afterwards we all went on to a party given by a\\nwoman called de Trommet.\"\\n\\n\"I know who you mean. American. She hasn\\'t paid for the toile-de-jouy\\nchair covers we made her last April. I had a dull time too; didn\\'t hold\\na card all the evening and came away four pounds ten to the bad.\"\\n\\n\"Poor mumsy.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m lunching at Viola Chasm\\'s. What are you doing? I didn\\'t order\\nanything here, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing so far. I can always go round to Bratt\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"But that\\'s so expensive. I\\'m sure if we ask Chambers she\\'ll be able to\\nget you something in. I thought you were certain to be out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I still may be. It isn\\'t twelve yet.\"\\n\\n(Most of Beaver\\'s invitations came to him at the last moment;\\noccasionally even later, when he had already begun to eat a solitary\\nmeal from a tray... \"John, darling, there\\'s been a muddle and Sonia has\\narrived without Reggie. Could you be an angel and help me out? Only be\\nquick, because we\\'re going in now\"... Then he would go headlong for a\\ntaxi and arrive, with apologies, after the first course... One of his\\nfew recent quarrels with his mother had occurred when he left a luncheon\\nparty of hers in this way.)\\n\\n\"Where are you going for the week-end?\"\\n\\n\"Hetton.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that? I forget.\"\\n\\n\"Tony Last.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course. She\\'s lovely, he\\'s rather a stick. I didn\\'t know you\\nknew them.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t really. Tony asked me in Bratt\\'s the other night. He may\\nhave forgotten.\"\\n\\n\"Send a telegram and remind them. It is far better than ringing up. It\\ngives them less chance to make excuses. Send it to-morrow just before\\nyou start. They owe me for a table.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s their dossier?\"\\n\\n\"I used to see her quite a lot before she married. She was Brenda Rex,\\nLord St Cloud\\'s daughter, very fair, underwater look. People used to be\\nmad about her when she was a girl. Everyone thought she would marry Jock\\nGrant-Menzies at one time. Wasted on Tony Last, he\\'s a prig. I should\\nsay it was time she began to be bored. They\\'ve been married five or six\\nyears. Quite well off but everything goes in keeping up the house. I\\'ve\\nnever seen it but I\\'ve an idea it\\'s huge and quite hideous. They\\'ve got\\none child at least, perhaps more.\"\\n\\n\"Mumsy, you are wonderful. I believe you know about everyone.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a great help. All a matter of paying attention while people are\\ntalking.\"\\n\\nMrs Beaver smoked a cigarette and then drove back to her shop. An\\nAmerican woman bought two patchwork quilts at thirty guineas each, Lady\\nMetroland telephoned about a bathroom ceiling, an unknown young man paid\\ncash for a cushion; in the intervals between these events, Mrs Beaver\\nwas able to descend to the basement where two dispirited girls were\\npacking lampshades. It was cold down there in spite of a little oil\\nstove, and the walls were always damp. The girls were becoming quite\\ndeft, she noticed with pleasure, particularly the shorter one who was\\nhandling the crates like a man.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the way,\" she said, \"you are doing very nicely, Joyce. I\\'ll soon\\nget you on to something more interesting.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mrs Beaver.\"\\n\\nThey had better stay in the packing department for a bit, Mrs Beaver\\ndecided; as long as they would stand it. They had neither of them enough\\nchic to work upstairs. Both had paid good premiums to learn Mrs Beaver\\'s\\nart.\\n\\nBeaver sat on beside his telephone. Once it rang and a voice said, \"Mr\\nBeaver? Will you please hold the line, sir, Mrs Tipping would like to\\nspeak to you.\"\\n\\nThe intervening silence was full of pleasant expectation. Mrs Tipping\\nhad a luncheon party that day, he knew; they had spent some time\\ntogether the evening before and he had been particularly successful with\\nher. Someone had chucked...\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr Beaver, I _am_ so sorry to trouble you. I was wondering, could\\nyou _possibly_ tell me the name of the young man you introduced to me\\nlast night at Madame de Trommet\\'s? The one with the reddish moustache. I\\nthink he was in Parliament.\"\\n\\n\"I expect you mean Jock Grant-Menzies.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s the name. You don\\'t by any chance know where I can find\\nhim, do you?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s in the book but I don\\'t suppose he\\'ll be at home now. You might be\\nable to get him at Bratt\\'s at about one. He\\'s almost always there.\"\\n\\n\"Jock Grant-Menzies, Bratt\\'s Club. Thank you so _very_ much. It _is_\\nkind of you. I hope you will come and see me some day. _Good_-bye.\"\\n\\nAfter that the telephone was silent.\\n\\nAt one o\\'clock Beaver despaired. He put on his overcoat, his gloves, his\\nbowler hat and with neatly rolled umbrella set off to his club, taking a\\npenny bus as far as the corner of Bond Street.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThe air of antiquity pervading Bratt\\'s, derived from its elegant\\nGeorgian fa?ade, and finely panelled rooms, was entirely spurious, for\\nit was a club of recent origin, founded in the burst of bonhomie\\nimmediately after the war. It was intended for young men, to be a place\\nwhere they could straddle across the fire and be jolly in the card-room\\nwithout incurring scowls from older members. But now these founders were\\nthemselves passing into middle age; they were heavier, balder and redder\\nin the face than when they had been demobilized, but their joviality\\npersisted and it was their turn now to embarrass their successors,\\ndeploring their lack of manly and gentlemanly qualities.\\n\\nSix broad backs shut Beaver from the bar. He settled in one of the\\narmchairs in the outer room and turned over the pages of the _New\\nYorker_, waiting until someone he knew should turn up.\\n\\nJock Grant-Menzies came upstairs. The men at the bar greeted him saying,\\n\"Hullo, Jock old boy, what are you drinking?\" or, more simply, \"Well,\\nold boy?\" He was too young to have fought in the war but these men\\nthought he was all right; they liked him far more than they did Beaver,\\nwho, they thought, ought never to have got into the club at all. But\\nJock stopped to talk to Beaver. \"Well, old boy,\" he said. \"What are you\\ndrinking?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing so far.\" Beaver looked at his watch. \"But I think it\\'s time I\\nhad one. Brandy and ginger ale.\"\\n\\nJock called to the barman and then said:\\n\\n\"Who was the old girl you wished on me at that party last night?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s called Mrs Tipping.\"\\n\\n\"I thought she might be. That explains it. They gave me a message\\ndownstairs that someone with a name like that wanted me to lunch with\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m no good at lunch parties. Besides, I decided when I got up that\\nI\\'d have oysters here.\"\\n\\nThe barman came with the drinks.\\n\\n\"Mr Beaver, sir, there\\'s ten shillings against you in my books for last\\nmonth.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, thank you, Macdougal, remind me some time, will you?\"\\n\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\n\\nBeaver said, \"I\\'m going to Hetton to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Are you now? Give Tony and Brenda my love.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the form?\"\\n\\n\"Very quiet and enjoyable.\"\\n\\n\"No paper games?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, nothing like that. A certain amount of bridge and backgammon\\nand low poker with the neighbours.\"\\n\\n\"Comfortable?\"\\n\\n\"Not bad. Plenty to drink. Rather a shortage of bathrooms. You can stay\\nin bed all the morning.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never met Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll like her, she\\'s a grand girl. I often think Tony Last\\'s one of\\nthe happiest men I know. He\\'s got just enough money, loves the place,\\none son he\\'s crazy about, devoted wife, not a worry in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Most enviable. You don\\'t know anyone else who\\'s going, do you? I was\\nwondering if I could get a lift down there.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t, I\\'m afraid. It\\'s quite easy by train.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but it\\'s more pleasant by road.\"\\n\\n\"And cheaper.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and cheaper I suppose... well, I\\'m going down to lunch. You won\\'t\\nhave another?\"\\n\\nBeaver rose to go.\\n\\n\"Yes, I think I will.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, all right. Macdougal. Two more, please.\"\\n\\nMacdougal said, \"Shall I book them to you, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if you will.\"\\n\\nLater, at the bar, Jock said, \"I made Beaver pay for a drink.\"\\n\\n\"He can\\'t have liked that.\"\\n\\n\"He nearly died of it. Know anything about pigs?\"\\n\\n\"No. Why.\"\\n\\n\"Only that they keep writing to me about them from my constituency.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBeaver went downstairs but before going into the dining-room he told the\\nporter to ring up his home and see if there was any message for him.\\n\\n\"Mrs Tipping rang up a few minutes ago and asked whether you could come\\nto luncheon with her to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Will you ring her up and say that I shall be delighted to, but that I\\nmay be a few minutes late?\"\\n\\nIt was just after half-past one when he left Bratt\\'s and walked at a\\ngood pace towards Hill Street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\nENGLISH GOTHIC\\n\\n\\n[I]\\n\\n_Between the villages of Hetton and Compton Last lies the\\nextensive park of Hetton Abbey. This, formerly one of the notable houses\\nof the county, was entirely rebuilt in 1864 in the Gothic style and is\\nnow devoid of interest. The grounds are open to the public daily until\\nsunset and the house may be viewed on application by writing. It\\ncontains some good portraits and furniture. The terrace commands a fine\\nview._\\n\\nThis passage from the county Guide Book did not cause Tony Last any\\nserious annoyance. Unkinder things had been said. His Aunt Frances,\\nembittered by an upbringing of unremitting severity, remarked that the\\nplans of the house must have been adapted by Mr Pecksniff from one of\\nhis pupils\" designs for an orphanage. But there was not a glazed brick\\nor encaustic tile that was not dear to Tony\\'s heart. In some ways, he\\nknew, it was not convenient to run; but what big house was? It was not\\naltogether amenable to modern ideas of comfort; he had many small\\nimprovements in mind, which would be put into effect as soon as the\\ndeath duties were paid off. But the general aspect and atmosphere of the\\nplace; the line of its battlements against the sky; the central clock\\ntower where quarterly chimes disturbed all but the heaviest sleepers;\\nthe ecclesiastical gloom of the great hall, its ceiling groined and\\npainted in diapers of red and gold, supported on shafts of polished\\ngranite with vine-wreathed capitals, half-lit by day through lancet\\nwindows of armorial stained glass, at night by a vast gasolier of brass\\nand wrought iron, wired now and fitted with twenty electric bulbs; the\\nblasts of hot air that rose suddenly at one\\'s feet, through grills of\\ncast-iron trefoils from the antiquated heating apparatus below; the\\ncavernous chill of the more remote corridors where, economizing in coke,\\nhe had had the pipes shut off; the dining-hall with its hammer-beam roof\\nand pitch-pine minstrels\" gallery; the bedrooms with their brass\\nbedsteads, each with a frieze of Gothic text, each named from Malory,\\nYseult, Elaine, Mordred and Merlin, Gawaine and Bedivere, Lancelot,\\nPerceval, Tristram, Galahad, his own dressing-room, Morgan le Fay, and\\nBrenda\\'s Guinevere, where the bed stood on a dais, the walls were hung\\nwith tapestry, the fireplace was like a tomb of the thirteenth century,\\nfrom whose bay window one could count, on days of exceptional clearness,\\nthe spires of six churches--all these things with which he had grown up\\nwere a source of constant delight and exultation to Tony; things of\\ntender memory and proud possession.\\n\\nThey were not in the fashion, he fully realized. Twenty years ago people\\nhad liked half timber and old pewter; now it was urns and colonnades;\\nbut the time would come, perhaps in John Andrew\\'s day, when opinion\\nwould reinstate Hetton in its proper place. Already it was referred to\\nas \"amusing\", and a very civil young man had asked permission to\\nphotograph it for an architectural review.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThe ceiling of Morgan le Fay was not in perfect repair. In order to make\\nan appearance of coffered wood, moulded slats had been nailed in a\\nchequer across the plaster. They were painted in chevrons of blue and\\ngold. The squares between were decorated alternately with Tudor roses\\nand fleurs-de-lis. But damp had penetrated into one corner, leaving a\\nlarge patch where the gilt had tarnished and the colour flaked away; in\\nanother place the wooden laths had become warped and separated from the\\nplaster. Lying in bed, in the grave ten minutes between waking and\\nringing, Tony studied these defects and resolved anew to have them put\\nright. He wondered whether it would be easy, nowadays, to find craftsmen\\ncapable of such delicate work.\\n\\nMorgan le Fay had been his room since he left the night-nursery. He had\\nbeen put there so that he would be within calling distance of his\\nparents (inseparable in Guinevere), for until quite late in his life he\\nwas subject to nightmares. He had taken nothing from the room since he\\nhad slept there, but every year added to its contents, so that it now\\nformed a gallery representative of every phase of his adolescence--the\\nframed picture of a dreadnought (a coloured supplement from _Chums_),\\nall its guns spouting flame and smoke; a photographic group of his\\nprivate school; a cabinet called \"the Museum\", filled with the fruits of\\na dozen desultory hobbies, eggs, butterflies, fossils, coins; his\\nparents, in the leather diptych which had stood by his bed at school;\\nBrenda, eight years ago when he had been trying to get engaged to her;\\nBrenda with John, taken just after the christening; an aquatint of\\nHetton, as it had stood until his great-grandfather demolished it; some\\nshelves of books, _Bevis_, _Woodwork at Home_, _Conjuring for All_, _The\\nYoung Visiters_, _The Law of Landlord and Tenant_, _Farewell to Arms_.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nAll over England people were waking up, queasy and despondent. Tony lay\\nfor ten minutes very happily planning the renovation of his ceiling.\\nThen he rang the bell.\\n\\n\"Has her ladyship been called yet?\"\\n\\n\"About a quarter of an hour ago, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll have breakfast in her room.\"\\n\\nHe put on his dressing-gown and slippers and went through into\\nGuinevere.\\n\\nBrenda lay on the dais.\\n\\nShe had insisted on a modern bed. Her tray was beside her and the quilt\\nwas littered with envelopes, letters and the daily papers. Her head was\\npropped against a very small blue pillow; clean of make-up, her face was\\nalmost colourless, rose-pearl, scarcely deeper in tone than her arms and\\nneck.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"Kiss.\"\\n\\nHe sat by the tray at the head of the bed; she leant forward to him (a\\nnereid emerging from fathomless depths of clear water). She turned her\\nlips away and rubbed against his cheek like a cat. It was a way she had.\\n\\n\"Anything interesting?\"\\n\\nHe picked up some of the letters.\\n\\n\"No. Mama wants nanny to send John\\'s measurements. She\\'s knitting him\\nsomething for Christmas. And the mayor wants me to open something next\\nmonth. I needn\\'t, need I?\"\\n\\n\"I think you\\'d better, we haven\\'t done anything for him for a long\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you must write the speech. I\\'m getting too old for the girlish\\none I used to give them all. And Angela says, will we stay for the New\\nYear?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy. Not on her life, we won\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"I guessed not... though it sounds an amusing party.\"\\n\\n\"You go if you like. I can\\'t possibly get away.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. I knew it would be \"no\" before I opened the letter.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what sort of pleasure can there be in going all the way to\\nYorkshire in the middle of winter?\"\\n\\n\"Darling, don\\'t be cross. I know we aren\\'t going. I\\'m not making a thing\\nabout it. I just thought it might be fun to eat someone else\\'s food for\\na bit.\"\\n\\nThen Brenda\\'s maid brought in the other tray. He had it put by the\\nwindow seat, and began opening his letters. He looked out of the window.\\nOnly four of the six church towers were visible that morning. Presently\\nhe said, \"As a matter of fact I probably _can_ manage to get away that\\nweek-end.\"\\n\\n\"Darling, are you sure you wouldn\\'t hate it?\"\\n\\n\"I daresay not.\"\\n\\nWhile he ate his breakfast Brenda read to him from the papers. \"Reggie\\'s\\nbeen making another speech... There\\'s such an extraordinary picture of\\nBabe and Jock... a woman in America has had twins by two different\\nhusbands. Would you have thought that possible?... Two more chaps in\\ngas ovens... a little girl has been strangled in a cemetery with a\\nbootlace... that play we went to about a farm is coming off.\" Then she\\nread him the serial. He lit his pipe. \"I don\\'t believe you\\'re listening.\\nWhy doesn\\'t Sylvia want Rupert to get the letter?\"\\n\\n\"Eh? Oh well, you see, she doesn\\'t really trust Rupert.\"\\n\\n\"I _knew_ it. There\\'s no such character as Rupert in the story. I shall\\nnever read to you again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, to tell you the truth I was just thinking.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"I was thinking how delightful it is, that it\\'s Saturday morning and we\\nhaven\\'t got anyone coming for the week-end.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you thought that?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it sometimes seems to me rather pointless keeping up a house this\\nsize if we don\\'t now and then ask some other people to stay in it.\"\\n\\n\"_Pointless?_ I can\\'t think what you mean. I don\\'t keep up this house to\\nbe a hostel for a lot of bores to come and gossip in. We\\'ve always lived\\nhere and I hope John will be able to keep it on after me. One has a duty\\ntowards one\\'s employees, and towards the place too. It\\'s a definite part\\nof English life which would be a serious loss if...\" Then Tony stopped\\nshort in his speech and looked at the bed. Brenda had turned on her face\\nand only the top of her head appeared above the sheets.\\n\\n\"Oh God,\" she said into the pillow. \"What have I done?\"\\n\\n\"I say, am I being pompous again?\"\\n\\nShe turned sideways so that her nose and one eye emerged. \"Oh no,\\ndarling, not _pompous_. You wouldn\\'t know how.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry.\"\\n\\nBrenda sat up. \"And, please, I didn\\'t mean it. I\\'m jolly glad too, that\\nno one\\'s coming.\"\\n\\n(These scenes of domestic playfulness had been more or less continuous\\nin Tony and Brenda\\'s life for seven years.)\\n\\nOutside, it was soft English weather; mist in the hollows and pale\\nsunshine on the hills; the coverts had ceased dripping, for there were\\nno leaves to hold the recent rain, but the undergrowth was wet, dark in\\nthe shadows, iridescent where the sun caught it; the lanes were soggy\\nand there was water running in the ditches.\\n\\nJohn Andrew sat his pony, solemn and stiff as a Lifeguard, while Ben\\nfixed the jump. Thunderclap had been a present on his sixth birthday\\nfrom Uncle Reggie. It was John who had named her, after lengthy\\nconsultation. Originally she had been called Christabelle which, as Ben\\nsaid, was more the name for a hound than a horse. Ben had known a\\nstrawberry roan called Thunderclap who killed two riders and won the\\nlocal point-to-point four years running. He had been a lovely little\\nhorse, said Ben, till he staked himself in the guts, hunting, and had to\\nbe shot. Ben knew stories about a great many different horses. There was\\none called Zero on whom he had won five Jimmy-o-goblins at ten to three\\nat Chester one year. And there was a mule he had known during the war,\\ncalled Peppermint, who had died of drinking the company\\'s rum ration.\\nBut John was not going to name his pony after a drunken mule. So in the\\nend they had decided on Thunderclap, in spite of her imperturbable\\ndisposition.\\n\\nShe was a dark bay, with long tail and mane. Ben had left her legs\\nshaggy. She cropped the grass, resisting John\\'s attempts to keep her\\nhead up.\\n\\nBefore her arrival riding had been a very different thing. He had jogged\\nround the paddock on a little Shetland pony called Bunny, with his nurse\\npanting at the bridle. Now it was a man\\'s business. Nanny sat at a\\ndistance, crocheting, on her camp stool; out of earshot. There had been\\na corresponding promotion in Ben\\'s position. From being the hand who\\nlooked after the farm horses, he was now, perceptibly, assuming the air\\nof a stud groom. The handkerchief round his neck gave place to a stock\\nwith a fox-head pin. He was a man of varied experience in other parts of\\nthe country.\\n\\nNeither Tony nor Brenda hunted but they were anxious that John should\\nlike it. Ben foresaw the time when the stables would be full and himself\\nin authority; it would not be like Mr Last to get anyone in from\\noutside.\\n\\nBen had got two posts bored for iron pegs, and a white-washed rail. With\\nthese he erected a two-foot jump in the middle of the field.\\n\\n\"Now take it quite easy. Canter up slow and when she takes off lean\\nforward in the saddle and you\\'ll be over like a bird. Keep her head\\nstraight at it.\"\\n\\nThunderclap trotted forwards, cantered two paces, thought better of it\\nand, just before the jump, fell into a trot again and swerved round the\\nobstacle. John recovered his balance by dropping the reins and gripping\\nthe mane with both hands; he looked guiltily at Ben, who said, \"What\\nd\\'you suppose your bloody legs are for? Here, take this and just give\\nher a tap when you get up to it!\" He handed John a switch.\\n\\nNanny sat by the gate re-reading a letter from her sister.\\n\\nJohn took Thunderclap back and tried the jump again. This time they made\\nstraight for the rail.\\n\\nBen shouted \"Legs!\" and John kicked sturdily, losing his stirrups. Ben\\nraised his arms as if scaring crows. Thunderclap jumped; John rose from\\nthe saddle and landed on his back in the grass.\\n\\nNanny rose in alarm. \"Oh, what\\'s happened, Mr Hacket, is he hurt?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s all right,\" said Ben.\\n\\n\"I\\'m all right,\" said John, \"I think she put in a short step.\"\\n\\n\"Short step my grandmother. You just opened your bloody legs and took an\\narser. Keep hold on to the reins next time. You can lose a hunt that\\nway.\"\\n\\nAt the third attempt John got over and found himself breathless and\\ninsecure, one stirrup swinging loose and one hand grabbing its old\\nsupport in the mane, but still in the saddle.\\n\\n\"There, how did that feel? You just skimmed over like a swallow. Try it\\nagain?\"\\n\\nTwice more John and Thunderclap went over the little rail, then nanny\\ncalled that it was time to go indoors for his milk. They walked the pony\\nback to the stable. Nanny said, \"Oh dear, look at all the mud on your\\ncoat.\"\\n\\nBen said, \"We\\'ll have you riding the winner at Aintree soon.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning, Mr Hacket.\"\\n\\n\"Good morning, miss.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye, Ben, may I come and see you doing the farm horses this\\nevening?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not for me to say. You must ask nanny. Tell you what though, the\\ngrey carthorse has got worms. Would you like to see me give him a pill?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes; please, nanny, may I?\"\\n\\n\"You must ask mother. Come along now, you\\'ve had quite enough of horses\\nfor one day.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t have enough of horses,\" said John, \"ever.\" On the way back to the\\nhouse he said, \"Can I have my milk in mummy\\'s room?\"\\n\\n\"That depends.\"\\n\\nNanny\\'s replies were always evasive, like that--\"We\\'ll see\" or \"That\\'s\\nasking\" or \"Those that ask no questions hear no lies\"--altogether unlike\\nBen\\'s decisive and pungent judgments.\\n\\n\"What does it depend on?\"\\n\\n\"Lots of things.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me one of them.\"\\n\\n\"On your not asking a lot of silly questions.\"\\n\\n\"Silly old tart.\"\\n\\n\"_John!_ How dare you? What do you mean?\"\\n\\nDelighted by the effect of this sally, John broke away from her hand and\\ndanced in front of her, saying, \"Silly old tart, silly old tart\" all the\\nway to the side entrance. When they entered the porch his nurse silently\\ntook off his leggings; he was sobered a little by her grimness.\\n\\n\"Go straight up to the nursery,\" she said. \"I am going to speak to your\\nmother about you.\"\\n\\n\"Please, nanny. I don\\'t know what it means, but I didn\\'t mean it.\"\\n\\n\"Go straight to the nursery.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda was doing her face.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been the same ever since Ben Hacket started teaching him to ride,\\nmy lady, there\\'s been no doing anything with him.\"\\n\\nBrenda spat in the eye-black. \"But, nanny, what exactly did he say?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t repeat it, my lady.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense, you must tell me. Otherwise I shall be thinking it something\\nfar worse than it was.\"\\n\\n\"It couldn\\'t have been worse... he called me a silly old tart, my\\nlady.\"\\n\\nBrenda choked slightly into her face towel. \"He said _that_?\"\\n\\n\"Repeatedly. He danced in front of me all the way up the drive, _singing\\nit_.\"\\n\\n\"I see... well, you were quite right to tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, my lady, and since we are talking about it I think I ought\\nto say that it seems to me that Ben Hacket is making the child go ahead\\nfar too quickly with his riding. It\\'s very dangerous. He had what might\\nhave been a serious fall this morning.\"\\n\\n\"All right, nanny, I\\'ll speak to Mr Last about it.\"\\n\\nShe spoke to Tony. They both laughed about it a great deal. \"Darling,\"\\nshe said, \"_you_ must speak to him. You\\'re so much better at being\\nserious than I am.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"I should have thought it was very nice to be called a tart,\" John\\nargued, \"and anyway it\\'s a word Ben often uses about people.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s got no business to.\"\\n\\n\"I like Ben more than anyone in the world. And I should think he\\'s\\ncleverer too.\"\\n\\n\"Now, you know you don\\'t like him more than your mother.\"\\n\\n\"Yes I do. _Far_ more.\"\\n\\nTony felt that the time had come to cut out the cross talk and deliver\\nthe homily he had been preparing. \"Now listen, John. It was very wrong\\nof you to call nanny a silly old tart. First, because it was unkind to\\nher. Think of all the things she does for you every day.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s paid to.\"\\n\\n\"Be quiet. And secondly, because you were using a word which people of\\nyour age and class do not use. Poor people use certain expressions which\\ngentlemen do not. You are a gentleman. When you grow up all this house\\nand lots of other things besides will belong to you. You must learn to\\nspeak like someone who is going to have these things and to be\\nconsiderate to people less fortunate than you, particularly women. Do\\nyou understand?\"\\n\\n\"Is Ben less fortunate than me?\"\\n\\n\"That has nothing to do with it. Now you are to go upstairs and say you\\nare sorry to nanny and promise never to use that word about anyone\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"All right.\"\\n\\n\"And because you have been so naughty to-day you are not to ride\\nto-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow\\'s Sunday.\"\\n\\n\"Well, next day then.\"\\n\\n\"But you said \"to-morrow\". It isn\\'t fair to change now.\"\\n\\n\"John, don\\'t argue. If you are not careful I shall send Thunderclap back\\nto Uncle Reggie and say that I find you are not a good enough boy to\\nkeep it. You wouldn\\'t like that, would you?\"\\n\\n\"What would Uncle Reggie do with her? She couldn\\'t carry him. Besides,\\nhe\\'s usually abroad.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'d give her to some other little boy. Anyway, that\\'s got nothing to\\ndo with it. Now run off and say you\\'re sorry to nanny.\"\\n\\nAt the door John said, \"It\\'s all right riding on Monday, isn\\'t it? You\\ndid _say_ \"to-morrow\".\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I suppose so.\"\\n\\n\"Hooray. Thunderclap went very well to-day. We jumped a big post and\\nrail. She refused first time but went like a bird after that.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you come off?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, once. It wasn\\'t Thunderclap\\'s fault. I just opened my bloody legs\\nand cut an arser.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"How did the lecture go?\" Brenda asked.\\n\\n\"Bad. Rotten bad.\"\\n\\n\"The trouble is that nanny\\'s jealous of Ben.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure we shan\\'t both be soon.\"\\n\\nThey lunched at a small, round table in the centre of the dining-hall.\\nThere seemed no way of securing an even temperature in that room; even\\nwhen one side was painfully roasting in the direct blaze of the open\\nhearth, the other was numbed by a dozen converging draughts. Brenda had\\ntried numerous experiments with screens and a portable electric\\nradiator, but with little success. Even to-day, mild elsewhere, it was\\nbitterly cold in the dining-hall.\\n\\nAlthough they were both in good health and of unexceptional figure, Tony\\nand Brenda were on a diet. It gave an interest to their meals and saved\\nthem from the two uncivilized extremes of which solitary diners are in\\ndanger--absorbing gluttony or an irregular r?gime of scrambled eggs and\\nraw beef sandwiches. Under their present system they denied themselves\\nthe combination of protein and starch at the same meal. They had a\\nprinted catalogue telling them which foods contained protein and which\\nstarch. Most normal dishes seemed to be compact of both, so that it was\\nfun for Tony and Brenda to choose the menu. Usually it ended by their\\ndeclaring some food \"joker\".\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure it does me a great deal of good.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, darling, and when we get tired of it we might try an alphabetical\\ndiet, having things beginning with a different letter every day. J would\\nbe hungry, nothing but jam and jellied eels... What are your plans for\\nthe afternoon?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing much. Carter\\'s coming up at five to go over a few things. I may\\ngo to Pigstanton after luncheon. I think we\\'ve got a tenant for Lowater\\nFarm but it\\'s been empty some time and I ought to see how much needs\\ndoing to it.\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t say \"no\" to going in to the \"movies\".\"\\n\\n\"All right. I can easily leave Lowater till Monday.\"\\n\\n\"And we might go to Woolworth\\'s afterwards, eh?\"\\n\\nWhat with Brenda\\'s pretty ways and Tony\\'s good sense, it was not\\nsurprising that their friends pointed to them as a pair who were\\npre-eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well\\ntogether.\\n\\nThe pudding, without protein, was unattractive.\\n\\nFive minutes afterwards a telegram was brought in. Tony opened it and\\nsaid \"Hell.\"\\n\\n\"Badders?\"\\n\\n\"Something too horrible has happened. Look at this.\"\\n\\nBrenda read. \"_Arriving 3.18 so looking forward visit. Beaver._\" And\\nasked, \"What\\'s Beaver?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a young man.\"\\n\\n\"That sounds all right.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no it\\'s not. Wait till you see him.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s he coming here for? Did you ask him to stay?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose I did in a vague kind of way. I went to Bratt\\'s one evening\\nand he was the only chap there so we had some drinks and he said\\nsomething about wanting to see the house...\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you were tight.\"\\n\\n\"Not really, but I never thought he\\'d hold it against me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it jolly well serves you right. That\\'s what comes of going up to\\nLondon on business and leaving me alone here... Who is he anyway?\"\\n\\n\"Just a young man. His mother keeps that shop.\"\\n\\n\"I used to know her. She\\'s hell. Come to think of it we owe her some\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"Look here, we must put a call through and say we\\'re ill.\"\\n\\n\"Too late, he\\'s in the train now, recklessly mixing starch and protein\\nin the Great Western three and sixpenny lunch... Anyway, he can go into\\nGalahad. No one who sleeps there ever comes again--the bed\\'s agony I\\nbelieve.\"\\n\\n\"What on earth are we going to do with him? It\\'s too late to get anyone\\nelse.\"\\n\\n\"You go over to Pigstanton. I\\'ll look after him. It\\'s easier alone. We\\ncan take him to the movies to-night, and to-morrow he can see over the\\nhouse. If we\\'re lucky he may go up by the evening train. Does he have to\\nwork on Monday morning?\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t know.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThree-eighteen was far from being the most convenient time for arrival.\\nOne reached the house at about a quarter to four and if, like Beaver,\\none was a stranger, there was an awkward time until tea; but without\\nTony there to make her self-conscious, Brenda could carry these things\\noff quite gracefully and Beaver was so seldom wholly welcome anywhere\\nthat he was not sensitive to the slight constraint of his reception.\\n\\nShe met him in what was still called the smoking-room; it was in some\\nways the least gloomy place in the house. She said, \"It is nice that you\\nwere able to come. I must break it to you at once that we haven\\'t got a\\nparty. I\\'m afraid you\\'ll be terribly bored... Tony had to go out but\\nhe\\'ll be in soon... was the train crowded? It often is on Saturdays...\\nwould you like to come outside? It\\'ll be dark soon and we might get some\\nof the sun while we can...\" and so on. If Tony had been there it would\\nhave been difficult, for she would have caught his eye and her manner as\\nch?telaine would have collapsed. Beaver was well used to making\\nconversation, so they went out together through the french windows on to\\nthe terrace, down the steps, into the Dutch garden, and back round the\\norangery without suffering a moment\\'s real embarrassment. She even heard\\nherself telling Beaver that his mother was one of her oldest friends.\\n\\nTony returned in time for tea. He apologized for not being at home to\\ngreet his guest and almost immediately went out again to interview the\\nagent in his study.\\n\\nBrenda asked about London and what parties there were. Beaver was\\nparticularly knowledgeable.\\n\\n\"Polly Cockpurse is having one soon.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Are you coming up for it?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t expect so. We never go anywhere nowadays.\"\\n\\nThe jokes that had been going round for six weeks were all new to\\nBrenda; they had become polished and perfected with repetition and\\nBeaver was able to bring them out with good effect. He told her of\\nnumerous changes of alliance among her friends.\\n\\n\"What\\'s happening to Mary and Simon?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, didn\\'t you know? That\\'s broken up.\"\\n\\n\"When?\"\\n\\n\"It began in Austria this summer...\"\\n\\n\"And Billy Angmering?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s having a terrific walk out with a girl called Sheila Shrub.\"\\n\\n\"And the Helm-Hubbards?\"\\n\\n\"That marriage isn\\'t going too well either... Daisy has started a new\\nrestaurant. It\\'s going very well... and there\\'s a new night club called\\nthe Warren...\"\\n\\n\"Dear me,\" Brenda said at last. \"What fun everyone seems to be having.\"\\n\\nAfter tea John Andrew was brought in and quickly usurped the\\nconversation. \"How do you do?\" he said. \"I didn\\'t know you were coming.\\nDaddy said he had a week-end to himself for once. Do you hunt?\"\\n\\n\"Not for a long time.\"\\n\\n\"Ben says it stands to reason everyone ought to hunt who can afford to,\\nfor the good of the country.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I can\\'t afford to.\"\\n\\n\"Are you poor?\"\\n\\n\"Please, Mr Beaver, you mustn\\'t let him bore you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, very poor.\"\\n\\n\"Poor enough to call people tarts?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, quite poor enough.\"\\n\\n\"How did you get poor?\"\\n\\n\"I always have been.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\" John lost interest in this topic. \"The grey horse at the farm has\\ngot worms.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know?\"\\n\\n\"Ben says so. Besides, you\\'ve only got to look at his dung.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear,\" said Brenda, \"what would nanny say if she heard you talking\\nlike that?\"\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-five. How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"What do you do?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing much.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if I was you I\\'d do something and earn some money. Then you\\'d be\\nable to hunt.\"\\n\\n\"But I shouldn\\'t be able to call people tarts.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see any point in that anyway.\"\\n\\n(Later, in the nursery, while he was having his supper, John said: \"I\\nthink Mr Beaver\\'s a very silly man, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know,\" said nanny.\\n\\n\"I think he\\'s the silliest man who\\'s ever been here.\"\\n\\n\"Comparisons are odious.\"\\n\\n\"There just isn\\'t anything nice about him. He\\'s got a silly voice and a\\nsilly face, silly eyes and silly nose,\" John\\'s voice fell into a\\nliturgical sing-song, \"silly feet and silly toes, silly head and silly\\nclothes...\"\\n\\n\"Now you eat up your supper,\" said nanny.)\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThat evening before dinner Tony came up behind Brenda as she sat at her\\ndressing table and made a face over her shoulder in the glass.\\n\\n\"I feel rather guilty about Beaver--going off and leaving you like that.\\nYou were heavenly to him.\"\\n\\nShe said, \"Oh, it wasn\\'t bad really. He\\'s rather pathetic.\"\\n\\nFarther down the passage Beaver examined his room, with the care of an\\nexperienced guest. There was no reading lamp. The inkpot was dry. The\\nfire had been lit but had gone out. The bathroom, he had already\\ndiscovered, was a great distance away, up a flight of turret steps. He\\ndid not at all like the look or feel of the bed; the springs were broken\\nin the centre and it creaked ominously when he lay down to try it. The\\nreturn ticket, third-class, had been eighteen shillings. Then there\\nwould be tips.\\n\\nOwing to Tony\\'s feeling of guilt they had champagne for dinner, which\\nneither he nor Brenda particularly liked. Nor, as it happened, did\\nBeaver, but he was glad that it was there. It was decanted into a tall\\njug and was carried round the little table, between the three of them,\\nas a pledge of hospitality. Afterwards they drove into Pigstanton to the\\nPicture-drome, where there was a film Beaver had seen some months\\nbefore. When they got back there was a grog tray and some sandwiches in\\nthe smoking-room. They talked about the film but Beaver did not let on\\nthat he had seen it. Tony took him to the door of Sir Galahad.\\n\\n\"I hope you sleep well.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I shall.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you like to be called in the morning?\"\\n\\n\"May I ring?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. Got everything you want?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, thanks. Good night.\"\\n\\n\"Good night.\"\\n\\nBut when he got back he said, \"You know, I feel awful about Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Beaver\\'s all right,\" said Brenda.\\n\\nBut he was far from being comfortable and as he rolled patiently about\\nthe bed in quest of a position in which it was possible to go to sleep,\\nhe reflected that, since he had no intention of coming to the house\\nagain, he would give the butler nothing and only five shillings to the\\nfootman who was looking after him. Presently he adapted himself to the\\nrugged topography of the mattress and dozed, fitfully, until morning.\\nBut the new day began dismally with the information that all the Sunday\\npapers had already gone to her ladyship\\'s room.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTony invariably wore a dark suit on Sundays and a stiff white collar. He\\nwent to church, where he sat in a large pitch-pine pew, put in by his\\ngreat-grandfather at the time of rebuilding the house, furnished with\\nvery high crimson hassocks and a fireplace, complete with iron grate and\\na little poker which his father used to rattle when any point in the\\nsermon excited his disapproval. Since his father\\'s day a fire had not\\nbeen laid there; Tony had it in mind to revive the practice next winter.\\nOn Christmas Day and Harvest Thanksgiving Tony read the lessons from the\\nback of the brass eagle.\\n\\nWhen service was over he stood for a few minutes at the porch chatting\\naffably with the vicar\\'s sister and the people from the village. Then he\\nreturned home by a path across the fields which led to a side door in\\nthe walled garden; he visited the hothouses and picked himself a\\nbuttonhole, stopped by the gardeners\\' cottages for a few words (the\\nsmell of Sunday dinners rising warm and overpowering from the little\\ndoorways) and then, rather solemnly, drank a glass of sherry in the\\nlibrary. That was the simple, mildly ceremonious order of his Sunday\\nmorning, which had evolved, more or less spontaneously, from the more\\nsevere practices of his parents; he adhered to it with great\\nsatisfaction. Brenda teased him whenever she caught him posing as an\\nupright, God-fearing gentleman of the old school and Tony saw the joke,\\nbut this did not at all diminish the pleasure he derived from his weekly\\nroutine, or his annoyance when the presence of guests suspended it.\\n\\nFor this reason his heart sank when, emerging from his study into the\\ngreat hall at a quarter to eleven, he met Beaver already dressed and\\nprepared to be entertained; it was only a momentary vexation, however,\\nfor while he wished him good morning he noticed that his guest had an\\n_A.B.C._ in his hands and was clearly looking out a train.\\n\\n\"I hope you slept all right?\"\\n\\n\"Beautifully,\" said Beaver, though his wan expression did not confirm\\nthe word.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so glad. I always sleep well here myself. I say, I don\\'t like the\\nlook of that train guide. I hope you weren\\'t thinking of leaving us\\nyet?\"\\n\\n\"Alas, I\\'ve got to get up to-night, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Too bad. I\\'ve hardly seen you. The trains aren\\'t very good on Sundays.\\nThe best leaves at five-forty-five and gets up about nine. It stops a\\nlot and there\\'s no restaurant car.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll do fine.\"\\n\\n\"Sure you can\\'t stay until to-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\n\\nThe church bells were ringing across the park.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m just off to church. I don\\'t suppose you\\'d care to come.\"\\n\\nBeaver always did what was expected of him when he was staying away,\\neven on a visit as unsatisfactory as the present one. \"Oh yes, I should\\nlike to very much.\"\\n\\n\"No, really, I shouldn\\'t if I were you. You wouldn\\'t enjoy it. I only go\\nbecause I more or less have to. You stay here. Brenda will be down\\ndirectly. Ring for a drink when you feel like it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, all right.\"\\n\\n\"See you later then.\" Tony took his hat and stick from the lobby and let\\nhimself out. \"Now I\\'ve behaved inhospitably to that young man again,\" he\\nreflected.\\n\\nThe bells were clear and clamorous in the drive and Tony walked briskly\\ntowards them. Presently they ceased and gave place to a single note,\\nwarning the village that there was only five minutes to go before the\\norganist started the first hymn.\\n\\nHe caught up nanny and John, also on their way to church. John was in\\none of his rare, confidential moods; he put his small gloved hand into\\nTony\\'s and, without introduction, embarked upon a story which lasted\\nthem all the way to the church door; it dealt with the mule Peppermint\\nwho had drunk the company\\'s rum ration, near Wipers in 1917; it was told\\nbreathlessly, as John trotted to keep pace with his father. At the end,\\nTony said, \"How very sad.\"\\n\\n\"Well, _I_ thought it was sad too, but it isn\\'t. Ben said it made him\\nlaugh fit to bust his pants.\"\\n\\nThe bell had stopped and the organist was watching from behind his\\ncurtain for Tony\\'s arrival. He walked ahead up the aisle, nanny and John\\nfollowing. In the pew he occupied one of the armchairs; they sat on the\\nbench at his back. He leant forward for half a minute with his forehead\\non his hand, and as he sat back, the organist played the first bars of\\nthe hymn, \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, O Lord...\" The\\nservice followed its course. As Tony inhaled the agreeable, slightly\\nmusty atmosphere and performed the familiar motions of sitting, standing\\nand leaning forward, his thoughts drifted from subject to subject, among\\nthe events of the past week and his plans for the future. Occasionally\\nsome arresting phrase in the liturgy would recall him to his\\nsurroundings, but for the most part that morning he occupied himself\\nwith the question of bathrooms and lavatories, and of how more of them\\ncould best be introduced without disturbing the character of his house.\\n\\nThe village postmaster took round the collecting bag. Tony put in his\\nhalf-crown; John and nanny their pennies.\\n\\nThe vicar climbed, with some effort, into the pulpit. He was an elderly\\nman who had served in India most of his life. Tony\\'s father had given\\nhim the living at the instance of his dentist. He had a noble and\\nsonorous voice and was reckoned the best preacher for many miles around.\\n\\nHis sermons had been composed in his more active days for delivery at\\nthe garrison chapel; he had done nothing to adapt them to the changed\\nconditions of his ministry and they mostly concluded with some reference\\nto homes and dear ones far away. The villagers did not find this in any\\nway surprising. Few of the things said in church seemed to have any\\nparticular reference to themselves. They enjoyed their vicar\\'s sermons\\nvery much and they knew that when he began about their distant homes, it\\nwas time to be dusting their knees and feeling for their umbrellas.\\n\\n\"...And so as we stand here bareheaded at this solemn hour of the\\nweek,\" he read, his powerful old voice swelling up for peroration, \"let\\nus remember our Gracious Queen Empress in whose service we are here, and\\npray that she may long be spared to send us at her bidding to do our\\nduty in the uttermost parts of the earth; and let us think of our dear\\nones far away and the homes we have left in her name, and remember that\\nthough miles of barren continent and leagues of ocean divide us, we are\\nnever so near to them as on these Sunday mornings, united with them\\nacross dune and mountain in our loyalty to our sovereign and\\nthanksgiving for her welfare; one with them as proud subjects of her\\nsceptre and crown.\"\\n\\n(\"The Reverend Tendril \"e do speak uncommon \"igh of the Queen,\" a\\ngardener\\'s wife had once remarked to Tony.)\\n\\nAfter the choir had filed out, during the last hymn, the congregation\\ncrouched silently for a few seconds and then made for the door. There\\nwas no sign of recognition until they were outside among the graves;\\nthen there was an exchange of greetings, solicitous, cordial, garrulous.\\n\\nTony spoke to the vet\\'s wife and Mr Partridge from the shop; then he was\\njoined by the vicar.\\n\\n\"Lady Brenda is not ill, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing serious.\" This was the invariable formula when he appeared\\nat church without her. \"A most interesting sermon, Vicar.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy, I\\'m delighted to hear you say so. It is one of my\\nfavourites. But have you never heard it before?\"\\n\\n\"No, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t used it here lately. When I am asked to supply elsewhere it\\nis the one I invariably choose. Let me see now, I always make a note of\\nthe times I use it.\" The old clergyman opened the manuscript book he was\\ncarrying. It had a limp black cover and the pages were yellow with age.\\n\"Ah yes, here we are. I preached it first in Jellalabad when the\\nColdstream Guards were there; then I used it in the Red Sea coming home\\nfrom my fourth leave; then at Sidmouth... Mentone... Winchester... to\\nthe Girl Guides at their summer rally in 1921... the Church Stage Guild\\nat Leicester... twice at Bournemouth during the winter of 1926 when\\npoor Ada was so ill... No, I don\\'t seem to have used it here since\\n1911, when you would have been too young to enjoy it...\"\\n\\nThe vicar\\'s sister had engaged John in conversation. He was telling\\nher the story of Peppermint: \"...he\\'d have been all right, Ben says,\\nif he had been able to cat the rum up, but mules can\\'t cat, neither\\ncan horses...\"\\n\\nNanny grasped him firmly and hurried him towards home. \"How many times\\nhave I told you not to go repeating whatever Ben Hacket tells you? Miss\\nTendril didn\\'t want to hear about Peppermint. And don\\'t ever use that\\nrude word \"cat\" again.\"\\n\\n\"It only means to be sick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Miss Tendril isn\\'t interested in being sick...\"\\n\\nAs the gathering between porch and lychgate began to disperse, Tony set\\noff towards the gardens. There was a good choice of buttonholes in the\\nhothouses; he picked lemon carnations with crinkled, crimson edges for\\nhimself and Beaver and a camellia for his wife.\\n\\nShafts of November sunshine streamed down from lancet and oriel,\\ntinctured in green and gold, gules and azure by the emblazoned coats,\\nbroken by the leaded devices into countless points and patches of\\ncoloured light. Brenda descended the great staircase step by step\\nthrough alternations of dusk and rainbow. Both hands were occupied,\\nholding to her breast a bag, a small hat, a half-finished panel of\\npetit-point embroidery and a vast, disordered sheaf of Sunday\\nnewspapers, above which only her eyes and forehead appeared as though\\nover a yashmak. Beaver emerged from the shadows below and stood at the\\nfoot of the stairs looking up at her.\\n\\n\"I say, can\\'t I carry something?\"\\n\\n\"No thanks, I\\'ve got everything safe. How did you sleep?\"\\n\\n\"Beautifully.\"\\n\\n\"I bet you didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not a very good sleeper.\"\\n\\n\"Next time you come you shall have a different room. But I daresay you\\nwon\\'t ever come again. People so seldom do. It is very sad because it\\'s\\nsuch fun for us having them and we never make any new friends living\\ndown here.\"\\n\\n\"Tony\\'s gone to church.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he likes that. He\\'ll be back soon. Let\\'s go out for a minute or\\ntwo, it looks lovely.\"\\n\\nWhen Tony came back they were sitting in the library. Beaver was telling\\nBrenda\\'s fortune with cards. \"... Now cut to me again,\" he was saying,\\n\"and I\\'ll see if it\\'s any clearer... Oh yes... there is going to be a\\nsudden death which will cause you great pleasure and profit. In fact you\\nare going to kill someone. I can\\'t tell if it\\'s a man or a woman...\\nyes, a woman... then you are going to go on a long journey across the\\nsea, marry six dark men and have eleven children, grow a beard and die.\"\\n\\n\"Beast. And all this time I\\'ve been thinking it was serious. Hullo,\\nTony. Jolly church?\"\\n\\n\"Most enjoyable; how about some sherry?\"\\n\\nWhen they were alone together, just before luncheon, he said, \"Darling,\\nyou\\'re being heroic with Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I quite enjoy coping--in fact I\\'m bitching him rather.\"\\n\\n\"So I saw. Well, I\\'ll look after him this afternoon and he\\'s going this\\nevening.\"\\n\\n\"Is he? I\\'ll be quite sorry. You know that\\'s a difference between us,\\nthat when someone\\'s awful you just run away and hide, while I actually\\nenjoy it--making up to them and showing off to myself how well I can do\\nit. Besides, Beaver isn\\'t so bad. He\\'s quite like us in some ways.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s not like me,\" said Tony.\\n\\nAfter luncheon Tony said, \"Well, if it would really amuse you, we might\\ngo over the house. I know it isn\\'t fashionable to like this sort of\\narchitecture now--my Aunt Frances says it is an authentic Pecksniff--but\\nI think it\\'s good of its kind.\"\\n\\nIt took them two hours. Beaver was well practised in the art of being\\nshown over houses; he had been brought up to it in fact, ever since he\\nhad begun to accompany his mother, whose hobby it had always been, and\\nlater, with changing circumstances, profession. He made apt and\\nappreciative comments and greatly enhanced the pleasure Tony always took\\nin exposing his treasures.\\n\\nThey saw it all: the shuttered drawing-room, like a school speech hall,\\nthe cloistral passages, the dark inner courtyard, the chapel where,\\nuntil Tony\\'s succession, family prayers had been daily read to the\\nassembled household, the plate-room and estate office, the bedrooms and\\nattics, the water-tank concealed among the battlements. They climbed the\\nspiral staircase into the works of the clock and waited to see it strike\\nhalf-past three. Thence they descended with ringing ears to the\\ncollections--enamel, ivories, seals, snuff-boxes, china, ormulu,\\ncloisonn?; they paused before each picture in the oak gallery and\\ndiscussed its associations; they took out the more remarkable folios in\\nthe library and examined prints of the original buildings, manuscript\\naccount-books of the old Abbey, travel journals of Tony\\'s ancestors. At\\nintervals Beaver would say, \"The So-and-so\\'s have got one rather like\\nthat at Such-and-such a place\", and Tony would say, \"Yes, I\\'ve seen it\\nbut I think mine is the earlier.\" Eventually they came back to the\\nsmoking-room and Tony left Beaver to Brenda.\\n\\nShe was stitching away at the petit-point, hunched in an armchair.\\n\"Well,\" she asked, without looking up from her needlework, \"what did you\\nthink of it?\"\\n\\n\"Magnificent.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t have to say that to me, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, a lot of the things are very fine.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, the _things_ are all right, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"But don\\'t you like the house?\"\\n\\n\"Me? I _detest_ it... at least I don\\'t mean that really, but I do wish\\nsometimes that it wasn\\'t _all_, every bit of it, so appallingly ugly.\\nOnly I\\'d die rather than say that to Tony. We could never live anywhere\\nelse, of course. He\\'s crazy about the place... It\\'s funny. None of us\\nminded very much when my brother Reggie sold _our_ house--and that was\\nbuilt by Vanbrugh, you know... I suppose we\\'re lucky to be able to\\nafford to keep it up at all. Do you know how much it costs just to live\\nhere? We should be quite rich if it wasn\\'t for that. As it is we support\\nfifteen servants indoors, besides gardeners and carpenters and a\\nnight-watchman and all the people at the farm and odd little men\\nconstantly popping in to wind the clocks and cook the accounts and clean\\nthe moat, while Tony and I have to fuss about whether it\\'s cheaper to\\ntake a car up to London for the night or buy an excursion ticket... I\\nshouldn\\'t feel so badly about it if it were a really lovely house--like\\nmy home for instance... but of course Tony\\'s been brought up here and\\nsees it all differently...\"\\n\\nTony joined them for tea. \"I don\\'t want to seem inhospitable, but if\\nyou\\'re going to catch that train, you ought really to be getting ready.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. I\\'ve persuaded him to stay on till to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'re sure you don\\'t...\"\\n\\n\"Splendid. I _am_ glad. It\\'s beastly going up at this time, particularly\\nby that train.\"\\n\\nWhen John came in he said, \"I thought Mr Beaver was going.\"\\n\\n\"Not till to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\nAfter dinner Tony sat and read the papers. Brenda and Beaver were on the\\nsofa playing games together. They did a cross-word. Beaver said, \"I\\'ve\\nthought of something\", and Brenda asked him questions to find what it\\nwas. He was thinking of the rum Peppermint drank. John had told him the\\nstory at tea. Brenda guessed it quite soon. Then they played \"Analogies\"\\nabout their friends and finally about each other.\\n\\nThey said good-bye that night because Beaver was catching the 9.10.\\n\\n\"Do let me know when you come to London.\"\\n\\n\"I may be up this week.\"\\n\\nNext morning Beaver tipped both butler and footman ten shillings each.\\nTony, still feeling rather guilty in spite of Brenda\\'s heroic coping,\\ncame down to breakfast to see his guest off. Afterwards he went back to\\nGuinevere.\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s the last of _him_. You were superb, darling. I\\'m sure he\\'s\\ngone back thinking that you\\'re mad about him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he wasn\\'t too awful.\"\\n\\n\"No. I must say he took a very intelligent interest when we went round\\nthe house.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nMrs Beaver was eating her yoghourt when Beaver reached home. \"Who was\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\"No one.\"\\n\\n\"No one? My poor boy.\"\\n\\n\"They weren\\'t expecting me. It was awful at first but got better. They\\nwere just as you said. She\\'s very charming. He scarcely spoke.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I saw her sometimes.\"\\n\\n\"She talked of taking a flat in London.\"\\n\\n\"_Did_ she?\" The conversion of stables and garages was an important part\\nof Mrs Beaver\\'s business. \"What does she want?\"\\n\\n\"Something quite simple. Two rooms and a bath. But it\\'s all quite vague.\\nShe hasn\\'t said anything to Tony yet.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure I shall be able to find her something.\"\\n\\n\\n[II]\\n\\nIf Brenda had to go to London for a day\\'s shopping, hair-cutting, or\\nbone-setting (a recreation she particularly enjoyed), she went on\\nWednesday, because the tickets on that day were half the usual price.\\nShe left at eight in the morning and got home soon after ten at night.\\nShe travelled third-class and the carriages were often full, because\\nother wives on the line took advantage of the cheap fare. She usually\\nspent the day with her younger sister, Marjorie, who was married to the\\nprospective Conservative candidate for a South London constituency of\\nstrong Labour sympathies. She was more solid than Brenda. The newspapers\\nused always to refer to them as \"the lovely Rex sisters\". Marjorie and\\nAllan were hard up and popular; they could not afford a baby; they lived\\nin a little house in the neighbourhood of Portman Square, very\\nconvenient for Paddington Station. They had a Pekingese dog named Djinn.\\n\\nBrenda had come on impulse, leaving the butler to ring up and tell\\nMarjorie of her arrival. She emerged from the train, after two hours and\\na quarter in a carriage crowded five a side, looking as fresh and\\nfragile as if she had that moment left a circle of masseuses,\\nchiropodists, manicurists and coiffeuses in an hotel suite. It was an\\naptitude she had, never to look half-finished; when she was really\\nexhausted, as she often was on her return to Hetton after these days in\\nLondon, she went completely to pieces quite suddenly and became a waif;\\nthen she would sit over the fire with a cup of bread and milk, hardly\\nalive, until Tony took her up to bed.\\n\\nMarjorie had her hat on and was sitting at her writing-table puzzling\\nover her cheque-book and a sheaf of bills.\\n\\n\"Darling, what _does_ the country do to you? You look like a thousand\\npounds. Where _did_ you get that suit?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. Some shop.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the news at Hetton?\"\\n\\n\"All the same. Tony madly feudal. John Andrew cursing like a stable\\nboy.\"\\n\\n\"And you?\"\\n\\n\"Me? Oh, I\\'m all right.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s been to stay?\"\\n\\n\"No one. We had a friend of Tony\\'s called Mr Beaver last week-end.\"\\n\\n\"John Beaver?... How very odd. I shouldn\\'t have thought he was at all\\nTony\\'s ticket.\"\\n\\n\"He wasn\\'t... What\\'s he like?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know him. I see him at Margot\\'s sometimes. He\\'s a great one\\nfor going everywhere.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he was rather pathetic.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s _pathetic_ all right. D\\'you fancy him?\"\\n\\n\"Heavens, no.\"\\n\\nThey took Djinn for a walk in the park. He was a very unrepaying dog who\\nnever looked about him and had to be dragged along by his harness; they\\ntook him to Watts\\'s _Physical Energy_; when loosed he stood perfectly\\nstill, gazing moodily at the asphalt until they turned towards home;\\nonly once did he show any sign of emotion, when he snapped at a small\\nchild who attempted to stroke him; later he got lost and was found a few\\nyards away, sitting under a chair and staring at a shred of waste paper.\\nHe was quite colourless, with pink nose and lips and pink circles of\\nbald flesh round his eyes. \"I don\\'t believe he has a spark of human\\nfeeling,\" said Marjorie.\\n\\nThey talked about Mr Cruttwell, their bone-setter, and Marjorie\\'s new\\ntreatment. \"He\\'s never done that to me,\" said Brenda enviously;\\npresently, \"What do you suppose is Mr Beaver\\'s sex-life?\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t know. Pretty dim, I imagine... You _do_ fancy him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh well,\" said Brenda, \"I don\\'t see such a lot of young men...\"\\n\\nThey left the dog at home and did some shopping--towels for the nursery,\\npickled peaches, a clock for one of the lodgekeepers who was celebrating\\nhis sixtieth year of service at Hetton, a pot of Morecambe Bay shrimps\\nas a surprise for Tony; they made an appointment with Mr Cruttwell for\\nthat afternoon. They talked about Polly Cockpurse\\'s party. \"Do come up\\nfor it. It\\'s certain to be amusing.\"\\n\\n\"I might... if I can find someone to take me. Tony doesn\\'t like her...\\nI can\\'t go to parties alone at my age.\"\\n\\nThey went out to luncheon, to a new restaurant in Albemarle Street which\\na friend of theirs named Daisy had recently opened. \"You\\'re in luck,\"\\nsaid Marjorie, as soon as they got inside the door, \"there\\'s your Mr\\nBeaver\\'s mother.\"\\n\\nShe was entertaining a party of eight at a large round table in the\\ncentre of the room; she was being paid to do so by Daisy, whose\\nrestaurant was not doing all she expected of it--that is to say the\\nluncheon was free and Mrs Beaver was getting the order, should the\\nrestaurant still be open, for its spring redecorations. It was,\\ntransparently, a made-up party, the guests being chosen for no mutual\\nbond--least of all affection for Mrs Beaver or for each other--except\\nthat their names were in current use--an accessible but not wholly\\nrenegade duke, an unmarried girl of experience, a dancer and a novelist\\nand a scene designer, a shamefaced junior minister who had not realized\\nwhat he was in for until too late, and Lady Cockpurse. \"God, what a\\nparty,\" said Marjorie, waving brightly to them all.\\n\\n\"You\\'re both coming to my party, darlings?\" Polly Cockpurse\\'s strident\\ntones rang across the restaurant. \"Only don\\'t tell anyone about it. It\\'s\\njust a very small, secret party. The house will only hold a few\\npeople--just old friends.\"\\n\\n\"It would be wonderful to see what Polly\\'s _real_ old friends were\\nlike,\" said Marjorie. \"She hasn\\'t known anyone more than five years.\"\\n\\n\"I wish Tony could see her point.\"\\n\\n(Although Polly\\'s fortune was derived from men, her popularity was\\nchiefly among women, who admired her clothes and bought them from her\\nsecond-hand at bargain prices; her first steps to eminence had been in\\ncircles so obscure that they had made her no enemies in the world to\\nwhich she aspired; some time ago she had married a good-natured earl,\\nwhom nobody else happened to want at the time; since then she had scaled\\nall but the highest peaks of every social mountain.)\\n\\nAfter luncheon Mrs Beaver came across to their table. \"I _must_ come and\\nspeak to you, though I\\'m in a great hurry. It\\'s _so_ long since we met\\nand John has been telling me about a _delightful_ week-end he had with\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"It was very quiet.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just what he _loves_. Poor boy, he gets rushed off his feet in\\nLondon. Tell me, Lady Brenda, is it true you are looking for a\\nflat?--because I think I\\'ve got just the place for you. It\\'s being done\\nup now and will be ready well before Christmas.\" She looked at her\\nwatch. \"Oh dear, I must fly. You couldn\\'t possibly come in for a\\ncocktail, this evening? Then you could hear all about it.\"\\n\\n\"I _could_...\" said Brenda doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Then _do_. I\\'ll expect you about six. I daresay you don\\'t know where I\\nlive?\" She told her and left the table.\\n\\n\"What\\'s all this about a flat?\" Marjorie asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, just something I thought of...\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThat afternoon, as she lay luxuriously on the osteopath\\'s table, and her\\nvertebrae, under his strong fingers, snapped like patent fasteners,\\nBrenda wondered whether Beaver would be at home that evening. \"Probably\\nnot, if he\\'s so keen on going about,\" she thought, \"and, anyhow, what\\'s\\nthe sense?...\"\\n\\nBut he was there, in spite of two other invitations.\\n\\nShe heard all about the maisonette. Mrs Beaver knew her job. What people\\nwanted, she said, was somewhere to dress and telephone. She was\\nsubdividing a small house in Belgravia into six flats at three pounds a\\nweek, of one room each and a bath; the bathrooms were going to be\\nslap-up, with limitless hot water and every transatlantic refinement;\\nthe other room would have a large built-in wardrobe with electric light\\ninside, and space for a bed. It would fill a long-felt need, Mrs Beaver\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll ask my husband and let you know.\"\\n\\n\"You _will_ let me know soon, won\\'t you, because _everyone_ will be\\nwanting one.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll let you know very soon.\"\\n\\nWhen she had to go, Beaver came with her to the station. She usually ate\\nsome chocolate and buns in her carriage; they bought them together at\\nthe buffet. There was plenty of time before the train left and the\\ncarriage was not yet full. Beaver came in and sat with her.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure you want to go away.\"\\n\\n\"No, really.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got lots to read.\"\\n\\n\"I _want_ to stay.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very sweet of you.\" Presently she said, rather timidly, for she\\nwas not used to asking for that sort of thing, \"I suppose you wouldn\\'t\\nlike to take me to Polly\\'s party, would you?\"\\n\\nBeaver hesitated. There would be several dinner parties that evening and\\nhe was almost certain to be invited to one or other of them... if he\\ntook Brenda out it would mean the Embassy or some smart restaurant...\\nthree pounds at least... and he would be responsible for her and have\\nto see her home... and if, as she said, she really did not know many\\npeople nowadays (why indeed should she have asked him if that were not\\ntrue?) it might mean tying himself up for the whole evening... \"I wish\\nI could,\" he said, \"but I\\'ve promised to dine out for it.\"\\n\\nBrenda had observed his hesitation. \"I was afraid you would have.\"\\n\\n\"But we\\'ll meet there.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, if I go.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could have taken you.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite all right... I just wondered.\"\\n\\nThe gaiety with which they had bought the buns was all gone now. They\\nwere silent for a minute. Then Beaver said, \"Well, I think perhaps I\\'ll\\nleave you now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, run along. Thank you for coming.\"\\n\\nHe went off down the platform. There were still eight minutes to go. The\\ncarriage suddenly filled up and Brenda felt tired out. \"Why _should_ he\\nwant to take me, poor boy?\" she thought. \"Only he might have done it\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Barnardo case?\"\\n\\nBrenda nodded. \"Down and out,\" she said, \"sunk, right under.\" She sat\\nnursing her bread and milk, stirring it listlessly. Every bit of her\\nfelt good for nothing.\\n\\n\"Good day?\"\\n\\nShe nodded. \"Saw Marjorie and her filthy dog. Bought some things.\\nLunched at Daisy\\'s new joint. Bone-setter. That\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"You know I wish you\\'d give up these day-trips to London. They\\'re far\\ntoo much for you.\"\\n\\n\"Me? Oh, I\\'m all right. Wish I was dead, that\\'s all... and please,\\nplease, darling Tony, don\\'t say anything about bed, because I can\\'t\\nmove.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nNext day a telegram came from Beaver. _Have got out of dinner 16th. Are\\nyou still free._\\n\\nShe replied: _Delighted. Second thoughts always best. Brenda._\\n\\nUp till then they had avoided Christian names.\\n\\n\"You seem in wonderful spirits to-day,\" Tony remarked.\\n\\n\"I feel big. I think it\\'s Mr Cruttwell. He puts all one\\'s nerves right\\nand one\\'s circulation and everything.\"\\n\\n\\n[III]\\n\\n\"Where\\'s mummy gone?\"\\n\\n\"London.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Someone called Lady Cockpurse is giving a party.\"\\n\\n\"Is she nice?\"\\n\\n\"Mummy thinks so. I don\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because she looks like a monkey.\"\\n\\n\"I should love to see her. Does she live in a cage? Has she got a tail?\\nBen saw a woman who looked like a fish, with scales all over instead of\\nskin. It was in a circus in Cairo. Smelt like a fish too, Ben says.\"\\n\\nThey were having tea together on the afternoon of Brenda\\'s departure.\\n\"Daddy, what does Lady Cockpurse eat?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, nuts and things.\"\\n\\n\"Nuts and what things?\"\\n\\n\"Different kinds of nuts.\"\\n\\nFor days to come the image of this hairy, mischievous Countess occupied\\nJohn Andrew\\'s mind. She became one of the inhabitants of his world, like\\nPeppermint, the mule who died of rum. When kindly people spoke to him in\\nthe village he would tell them about her and how she swung head down\\nfrom a tree throwing nutshells at passers-by.\\n\\n\"You mustn\\'t say things like that about real people,\" said nanny.\\n\"Whatever would Lady Cockpurse do if she heard about it?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'d gibber and chatter and lash round with her tail, and then I\\nexpect she\\'d catch some nice, big, juicy fleas and forget all about it.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda was staying at Marjorie\\'s for the night. She was dressed first\\nand came into her sister\\'s room. \"Lovely, darling. New?\"\\n\\n\"Fairly.\"\\n\\nMarjorie was rung up by the woman at whose house she was dining. (\"Look\\nhere, are you absolutely sure you can\\'t make Allan come to-night?\"\\n\"Absolutely. He\\'s got a meeting in Camberwell. He may not even come to\\nPolly\\'s.\" \"Is there _any_ man you can bring?\" \"Can\\'t think of anybody.\"\\n\"Well, we shall have to be one short, that\\'s all. I can\\'t think what\\'s\\nhappened to-night. I rang up John Beaver but even _he_ won\\'t come.\")\\n\\n\"You know,\" said Marjorie, putting down the telephone, \"you\\'re causing a\\ngreat deal of trouble. You\\'ve taken London\\'s only spare man.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, I didn\\'t realize...\"\\n\\nBeaver arrived at quarter to nine in a state of high self-approval; he\\nhad refused two invitations to dinner while dressing that evening; he\\nhad cashed a cheque for ten pounds at his club; he had booked a divan\\ntable at Espinosa\\'s. It was almost the first time in his life that he\\nhad taken anyone out to dinner, but he knew perfectly well how it was\\ndone.\\n\\n\"I must see your Mr Beaver properly,\" said Marjorie. \"Let\\'s make him\\ntake off his coat and drink something.\"\\n\\nThe two sisters were a little shy as they came downstairs, but Beaver\\nwas perfectly at his ease. He looked very elegant and rather more than\\nhis age.\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s not so bad, your Mr Beaver,\" Marjorie\\'s look seemed to say,\\n\"not by any means,\" and he, seeing the two women together, who were both\\nbeautiful, though in a manner so different that, although it was\\napparent that they were sisters, they might have belonged each to a\\nseparate race, began to understand what had perplexed him all the week;\\nwhy, contrary to all habit and principle, he had telegraphed to Brenda\\nasking her to dine.\\n\\n\"Mrs Jimmy Deane\\'s very upset that she couldn\\'t get you for to-night. I\\ndidn\\'t give away what you were doing.\"\\n\\n\"Give her my love,\" said Beaver. \"Anyway we\\'ll all meet at Polly\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"I must go, we\\'re dining at nine.\"\\n\\n\"Stay a bit,\" said Brenda. \"She\\'s sure to be late.\"\\n\\nNow that it was inevitable, she did not want to be left alone with\\nBeaver.\\n\\n\"No, I must go. Enjoy yourselves, bless you both.\" She felt as though\\nshe were the elder sister, seeing Brenda timid and expectant at the\\nbeginning of an adventure.\\n\\nThey were awkward when Marjorie left, for in the week that they had been\\napart, each had, in thought, grown more intimate with the other than any\\nactual occurrence warranted. Had Beaver been more experienced, he might\\nhave crossed to where Brenda was sitting on the arm of a chair, and made\\nlove to her at once; and probably he would have got away with it.\\nInstead he remarked in an easy manner, \"I suppose we ought to be going\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, where?\"\\n\\n\"I thought Espinosa\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, lovely. Only listen. I want you to understand right away that it\\'s\\n_my_ dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Of course not... nothing of the sort.\"\\n\\n\"Yes it is. I\\'m a year older than you and an old married woman and quite\\nrich, so, please, I\\'m going to pay.\"\\n\\nBeaver continued protesting to the taxi door.\\n\\nBut there was still a constraint between them and Beaver began to\\nwonder, \"Does she expect me to pounce?\" So, as they waited in a traffic\\nblock by the Marble Arch, he leaned forward to kiss her; when he was\\nquite near, she drew back. He said, \"_Please_, Brenda,\" but she turned\\naway and looked out of the window, shaking her head several times\\nquickly. Then, her eyes still fixed on the window, she put out her hand\\nto his and they sat in silence till they reached the restaurant.\\n\\nBeaver was thoroughly puzzled.\\n\\nOnce they were in public again, his confidence returned. Espinosa led\\nthem to their table; it was the one by itself on the right of the door,\\nthe only table in the restaurant at which one\\'s conversation was not\\noverheard. Brenda handed him the card. \"You choose. Very little for me,\\nbut it must only have starch, no protein.\"\\n\\nThe bill at Espinosa\\'s was, as a rule, roughly the same whatever one\\nate, but Brenda would not know this, so, since it was now understood\\nthat she was paying, Beaver felt constrained from ordering anything that\\nlooked obviously expensive. However, she insisted on champagne, and\\nlater a ballon of liqueur brandy for him. \"You can\\'t think how exciting\\nit is for me to take a young man out. I\\'ve never done it before.\"\\n\\nThey stayed at Espinosa\\'s until it was time to go to the party, dancing\\nonce or twice, but most of the time sitting at the table, talking. Their\\ninterest in each other had so far outdistanced their knowledge that\\nthere was a great deal to say.\\n\\nPresently Beaver said, \"I\\'m sorry I was an ass in the taxi just now.\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\"\\n\\nHe changed it and said, \"Did you mind when I tried to kiss you just\\nnow?\"\\n\\n\"Me? No, not particularly.\"\\n\\n\"Then why wouldn\\'t you let me?\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, you\\'ve got a lot to learn.\"\\n\\n\"How d\\'you mean?\"\\n\\n\"You mustn\\'t ever ask questions like that. Will you try and remember?\"\\n\\nThen he was sulky. \"You talk to me as if I was an undergraduate having\\nhis first walk out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, is this a walk out?\"\\n\\n\"Not as far as I am concerned.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause in which Brenda said, \"I am not sure it hasn\\'t been a\\nmistake, taking you out to dinner. Let\\'s ask for the bill and go to\\nPolly\\'s.\"\\n\\nBut they took ten minutes to bring the bill, and in that time Beaver and\\nBrenda had to say something, so he said he was sorry.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to _learn_ to be nicer,\" she said soberly. \"I don\\'t believe\\nyou\\'d find it impossible.\" When the bill eventually came, she said, \"How\\nmuch do I tip him?\" and Beaver showed her. \"Are you sure that\\'s enough?\\nI should have given twice as much.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s exactly right,\" said Beaver, feeling older again, just as Brenda\\nhad meant him to feel.\\n\\nWhen they sat in the taxi Beaver knew at once that Brenda wished him to\\nmake love to her. But he decided it was time she took the lead. So he\\nsat at a distance from her and commented on an old house that was being\\ndemolished to make way for a block of flats.\\n\\n\"Shut up,\" said Brenda. \"Come here.\"\\n\\nWhen he had kissed her, she rubbed against his cheek in the way she had.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nPolly\\'s party was exactly what she wished it to be, an accurate replica\\nof all the best parties she had been to in the last year; the same band,\\nthe same supper and, above all, the same guests. Hers was not the\\nambition to create a sensation, to have the party talked about in months\\nto come for any unusual feature, to hunt out shy celebrities or\\nintroduce exotic strangers. She wanted a perfectly straight, smart party\\nand she had got it. Practically everyone she asked had come. If there\\nwere other, more remote worlds upon which she did not impinge, Polly did\\nnot know about them. These were the people she was after, and here they\\nwere. And looking round on her guests, with Lord Cockpurse, who was for\\nthe evening loyally putting in one of his rare appearances, at her side,\\nshe was able to congratulate herself that there were very few people\\npresent whom she did not want. In other years people had taken her\\nhospitality more casually and brought on with them anyone with whom they\\nhappened to have been dining. This year, without any conscious effort on\\nher part, there had been more formality. Those who wanted to bring\\nfriends had rung up in the morning and asked whether they might do so,\\nand on the whole they had been cautious of even so much presumption.\\nPeople who, only eighteen months before, would have pretended to be\\nignorant of her existence were now crowding up her stairs. She had got\\nherself in line with the other married women of her world.\\n\\nAs they started to go up, Brenda said, \"You\\'re not to leave me, please.\\nI\\'m not going to know anybody,\" and Beaver again saw himself as the\\ndominant male.\\n\\nThey went straight through to the band and began dancing, not talking\\nmuch except to greet other couples whom they knew. They danced for half\\nan hour and then she said \"All right, I\\'ll give you a rest. Only don\\'t\\nlet me get left.\"\\n\\nShe danced with Jock Grant-Menzies and two or three old friends and did\\nnot see Beaver again until she came on him alone in the bar. He had been\\nthere a long time, talking sometimes to the couples who came in and out,\\nbut always ending up alone. He was not enjoying the evening and he told\\nhimself rather resentfully that it was because of Brenda; if he had come\\nthere in a large party it would have been different.\\n\\nBrenda saw he was out of temper and said, \"Time for supper.\"\\n\\nIt was early, and the tables were mostly empty except for earnest\\ncouples sitting alone. There was a large round table between the\\nwindows, with no one at it; they sat there.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t propose to move for a long time, d\\'you mind?\" She wanted to\\nmake him feel important again, so she asked him about the other people\\nin the room.\\n\\nPresently their table filled up. These were Brenda\\'s old friends, among\\nwhom she used to live when she came out and in the first two years of\\nher marriage, before Tony\\'s father died; men in the early thirties,\\nmarried women of her own age, none of whom knew Beaver or liked him. It\\nwas by far the gayest table in the room. Brenda thought \"How my poor\\nyoung man must be hating this\"; it did not occur to her that, from\\nBeaver\\'s point of view, these old friends of hers were quite the most\\ndesirable people at the party, and that he was delighted to be seen at\\ntheir table. \"Are you dying of it?\" she whispered.\\n\\n\"No, indeed, never happier.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I am. Let\\'s go and dance.\"\\n\\nBut the band was taking a rest and there was no one in the ballroom\\nexcept the earnest couples who had migrated there away from the crowd\\nand were sitting huddled in solitude round the walls, lost in\\nconversation. \"Oh dear,\" said Brenda, \"now we\\'re done. We can\\'t go back\\nto the table... it almost looks as though we should have to go home.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not two.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s late for me. Look here, don\\'t you come. Stay and enjoy\\nyourself.\"\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'ll come,\" said Beaver.\\n\\nIt was a cold, clear night. Brenda shivered and he put his arm round her\\nin the taxi. They did not say much.\\n\\n\"There already?\"\\n\\nThey sat for a few seconds without moving. Then Brenda slipped free and\\nBeaver got out.\\n\\n\"I am afraid I can\\'t ask you in for a drink. You see it isn\\'t my house\\nand I shouldn\\'t know where to find anything.\"\\n\\n\"No, of course not.\"\\n\\n\"Well, good night, my dear. Thank you a thousand times for looking after\\nme. I\\'m afraid I rather bitched your evening.\"\\n\\n\"No, of course not,\" said Beaver.\\n\\n\"Will you ring me in the morning... promise?\" She touched her hand to\\nher lips and then turned to the keyhole.\\n\\nBeaver hesitated a minute whether he should go back to the party, but\\ndecided not to. He was near home, and everyone at Polly\\'s would have\\nsettled down by now; so he gave his address in Sussex Gardens, and went\\nup to bed.\\n\\nJust as he was undressed he heard the telephone ringing downstairs. It\\nwas his telephone. He went down, two flights in the cold. It was\\nBrenda\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"Darling, I was just going to ring off. I thought you must have gone\\nback to Polly\\'s. Is the telephone not by your bed?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s on the ground floor.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, then it wasn\\'t a very good idea to ring up, was it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know. What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Just to say \"good night\".\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see, well--good night.\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'ll ring me in the morning?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Early, before you\\'ve made any plans.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Then good night, bless you.\"\\n\\nBeaver went up the two flights of stairs again, and got into bed.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"...going away in the middle of the party.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell you how innocent it was. He didn\\'t even come in.\"\\n\\n\"No one is going to know that.\"\\n\\n\"And he was furious when I rang him up.\"\\n\\n\"What does he think of you?\"\\n\\n\"Simply can\\'t make me out at all... terribly puzzled, and rather bored\\nin bits.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going to go on with it?\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t know.\" The telephone rang. \"Perhaps that\\'s him.\"\\n\\nBut it was not.\\n\\nBrenda had come into Marjorie\\'s room and they were having breakfast in\\nbed. Marjorie was more than ever like an elder sister that morning.\\n\"But, really, Brenda, he\\'s such a _dreary_ young man.\"\\n\\n\"I know it all. He\\'s second rate and a snob and, I should think, as cold\\nas a fish, but I happen to have a fancy for him, that\\'s all... besides\\nI\\'m not sure he\\'s _altogether_ awful... he\\'s got that odious mother\\nwhom he adores... and he\\'s always been very poor. I don\\'t think he\\'s\\nhad a fair deal. I heard all about it last night. He got engaged once\\nbut they couldn\\'t get married because of money and since then he\\'s never\\nhad a proper affair with anyone decent... he\\'s got to be taught a whole\\nlot of things. That\\'s part of his attraction.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, I see you\\'re very serious.\"\\n\\nThe telephone rang.\\n\\n\"Perhaps _that\\'s_ him.\"\\n\\nBut a familiar voice rang out from the instrument so that Brenda could\\nhear it, \"Good morning, darling, what\\'s the dirt to-day?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Polly, what a good party last night.\"\\n\\n\"Not so bad for the old girl, was it? I say, what about your sister and\\nMr Beaver?\"\\n\\n\"What about them?\"\\n\\n\"How long has _that_ been on?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing doing there, Polly.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you tell me. They were well away last night. How\\'s the boy\\nmanaged it? That\\'s what I want to know. He must have something we didn\\'t\\nknow about...\"\\n\\n\"So Polly\\'s on to your story. She\\'ll be telling everyone in London at\\nthis moment.\"\\n\\n\"How I wish there was anything to tell! The cub hasn\\'t even rung me\\nup... Well, I\\'ll leave him in peace. If he doesn\\'t do anything about me,\\nI\\'ll go down to Hetton this afternoon. Perhaps that\\'s him.\" But it was\\nonly Allan from the Conservative Central Office, to say how sorry he had\\nbeen not to get to the party the night before. \"I hear Brenda disgraced\\nherself,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Goodness,\" said Brenda. \"People do think that young men are easily come\\nby.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"I scarcely saw you at Polly\\'s last night,\" said Mrs Beaver. \"What\\nbecame of you?\"\\n\\n\"We went early. Brenda Last was tired.\"\\n\\n\"She was looking lovely. I am so glad you\\'ve made friends with her. When\\nare you going to see her again?\"\\n\\n\"I said I\\'d ring up.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, mumsy, what\\'s the use? I can\\'t afford to start taking about women\\nlike Brenda Last. If I ring up she\\'ll say, what are you doing, and I\\nshall have to ask her to something, and it will be the same thing every\\nday. I simply haven\\'t the money.\"\\n\\n\"I know, my son. It\\'s very difficult for you... and you\\'re wonderful\\nabout money. I ought to be grateful that I haven\\'t a son always coming\\nto me with debts. Still, it doesn\\'t do to deny yourself _everything_,\\nyou know. You\\'re getting to be an old bachelor already at twenty-five. I\\ncould see Brenda liked you, that evening she came here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, she likes me all right.\"\\n\\n\"I hope she makes up her mind about that flat. They\\'re going like hot\\ncakes. I shall have to look about for another suitable house to split\\nup. You\\'d be surprised who\\'ve been taking them--quite a number of people\\nwith houses in London already... Well, I must be getting back to work.\\nI\\'m away for two nights by the way. See that Chambers looks after you\\nproperly. There are some Australians Sylvia Newport discovered who want\\nto take a house in the country, so I\\'m driving them round to one or two\\nthat might do for them. Where are you lunching?\"\\n\\n\"Margot\\'s.\"\\n\\nBy one o\\'clock, when they came back from taking Djinn to the park,\\nBeaver had not rung up. \"So that\\'s that,\" said Brenda, \"I daresay I\\'m\\nglad really.\" She sent a telegram to Tony to expect her by the afternoon\\ntrain and, in a small voice, ordered her things to be packed. \"I don\\'t\\nseem to have anywhere to lunch,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you come to Margot\\'s? I know she\\'d love it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, ring up and ask her.\"\\n\\nSo she met Beaver again.\\n\\nHe was sitting some way from her and they did not speak to each other\\nuntil everyone was going. \"I kept trying to get through to you this\\nmorning,\" he said, \"but the line was always engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come on,\" said Brenda, \"I\\'ll sock you a movie.\"\\n\\nLater she wired to Tony: _Staying with Marjorie another day or two all\\nlove to you both_.\\n\\n\\n[IV]\\n\\n\"Is mummy coming back to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I hope so.\"\\n\\n\"That monkey-woman\\'s party has lasted a long time. Can I come in to the\\nstation and meet her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'ll both go.\"\\n\\n\"She hasn\\'t seen Thunderclap for four days. She hasn\\'t seen me jump the\\nnew post and rail, has she, daddy?\"\\n\\nShe was coming by the 3.18. Tony and John Andrew were there early. They\\nwandered about the station looking at things, and bought some chocolate\\nfrom a slot machine. The stationmaster came out to talk to them. \"Her\\nladyship coming back to-day?\" He was an old friend of Tony\\'s.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been expecting her every day. You know what it is when ladies get\\nto London.\"\\n\\n\"Sam Brace\\'s wife went to London and he couldn\\'t get her back. Had to go\\nup and fetch her himself. And then she give him a hiding.\"\\n\\nPresently the train came in and Brenda emerged exquisitely from her\\nthird-class carriage. \"You\\'ve _both_ come. What angels you are. I don\\'t\\nat all deserve it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, mummy, have you brought the monkey-lady?\"\\n\\n\"What _does_ the child mean?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s got it into his head that your chum Polly has a tail.\"\\n\\n\"Come to think of it, I shouldn\\'t be surprised if she had.\"\\n\\nTwo little cases held all her luggage. The chauffeur strapped them on\\nbehind the car, and they drove to Hetton.\\n\\n\"What\\'s all the news?\"\\n\\n\"Ben\\'s put the rail up ever so high and Thunderclap and I jumped it six\\ntimes yesterday and six times again to-day and two more of the fish in\\nthe little pond are dead, floating upside down all swollen and nanny\\nburnt her finger on the kettle yesterday and daddy and I saw a fox just\\nas near as anything and he sat quite still and then went away into the\\nwood and I began drawing a picture of a battle only I couldn\\'t finish it\\nbecause the paints weren\\'t right and the grey carthorse the one that had\\nworms is quite well again.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing much has happened,\" said Tony. \"We\\'ve missed you. What did you\\nfind to do in London all this time?\"\\n\\n\"Me? Oh, I\\'ve been behaving rather badly to tell you the truth.\"\\n\\n\"Buying things?\"\\n\\n\"Worse. I\\'ve been carrying on madly with young men and I\\'ve spent heaps\\nof money and I\\'ve enjoyed it very much indeed. But there\\'s one awful\\nthing.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"No, I think it had better keep. It\\'s something you won\\'t like at all.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve bought a Pekingese.\"\\n\\n\"Worse, far worse. Only I haven\\'t done it yet. But I _want_ to\\ndreadfully.\"\\n\\n\"Go on.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, I\\'ve found a flat.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'d better lose it again, quick.\"\\n\\n\"All right. I\\'ll attack you about it again later. Meanwhile, try not to\\nbrood about it.\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t give it another thought.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s a flat, daddy?\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda wore pyjamas at dinner, and afterwards sat close to Tony on the\\nsofa and ate some sugar out of his coffee cup.\\n\\n\"I suppose all this means that you\\'re going to start again about your\\nflat?\"\\n\\n\"Mmmm.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t signed any papers yet, have you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no.\" Brenda shook her head emphatically.\\n\\n\"Then no great harm\\'s done.\" Tony began to fill his pipe.\\n\\nBrenda knelt on the sofa, sitting back on her heels. \"Listen, you\\nhaven\\'t been brooding?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Because, you see, when you say \\'flat\\' you\\'re thinking of something\\nquite different to me. _You_ mean by a flat, a lift and a man in\\nuniform, and a big front door with knobs, and an entrance hall and doors\\nopening in all directions, with kitchens and sculleries and dining-rooms\\nand drawing-rooms and servants\\' bedrooms... don\\'t you, Tony?\"\\n\\n\"More or less.\"\\n\\n\"_Exactly._ Now _I_ mean just a bedroom and a bath and a telephone. You\\nsee the difference? Now a woman I know--\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"Just a woman--has fixed up a whole house like that off Belgrave Square\\nand they are three pounds a week, no rates and taxes, constant hot water\\nand central heating, woman comes in to make the bed when required, what\\nd\\'you think of that?\"\\n\\n\"I see.\"\\n\\n\"Now this is how I look at it. What\\'s three pounds a week? Less than\\nnine bob a night. Where could one stay for less than nine bob a night\\nwith all those advantages? You\\'re always going to the club, and that\\ncosts more, and I can\\'t stay often with Marjorie because it\\'s hell for\\nher having me, and anyway she\\'s got that dog, and you\\'re always saying\\nwhen I come back in the evenings after shopping, \"Why didn\\'t you stay\\nthe night,\" you say, \"instead of killing yourself?\" Time and again you\\nsay it. I\\'m sure we spend much more than three pounds a week through not\\nhaving a flat. Tell you what, I\\'ll give up Mr Cruttwell. How\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you really want this thing?\"\\n\\n\"Mmm.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll have to see. We _might_ manage it, but it\\'ll mean putting\\noff the improvements down here.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t really deserve it,\" she said, clinching the matter. \"I\\'ve been\\ncarrying on _anyhow_ this week.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda\\'s stay at Hetton lasted only for three nights. Then she returned\\nto London, saying that she had to see about the flat. It did not,\\nhowever, require very great attention. There was only the colour of the\\npaint to choose and some few articles of furniture. Mrs Beaver had them\\nready for her inspection, a bed, a carpet, a dressing table and\\nchair--there was not room for more. Mrs Beaver tried to sell her a set\\nof needlework pictures for the walls, but these she refused, also an\\nelectric bed-warmer, a miniature weighing machine for the bathroom, a\\nFrigidaire, an antique grandfather clock, a backgammon set of\\nlooking-glass and synthetic ivory, a set of prettily bound French\\neighteenth-century poets, a massage apparatus, and a wireless set fitted\\nin a case of Regency lacquer, all of which had been grouped in the shop\\nfor her as a \"suggestion\". Mrs Beaver bore Brenda no ill will for the\\nmodesty of her requirements; she was doing very well on the floor above\\nwith a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium\\nplating at immense expense.\\n\\nMeanwhile Brenda stayed with Marjorie, on terms which gradually became\\nacrimonious. \"I\\'m sorry to be pompous,\" she said one morning, \"but I\\njust don\\'t want your Mr Beaver hanging about the house all day and\\ncalling me Marjorie.\"\\n\\n\"Oh well, the flat won\\'t be long now.\"\\n\\n\"And I shall go on saying that I think you\\'re making a ridiculous\\nmistake.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s just that you don\\'t like Mr Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t only that. I think it\\'s hard cheese on Tony.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Tony\\'s all right.\"\\n\\n\"And if there\\'s a row--\"\\n\\n\"There won\\'t be a row.\"\\n\\n\"You never know. If there is, I don\\'t want Allan to think I\\'ve been\\nhelping to arrange things.\"\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t so disagreeable to you about Robin Beaseley.\"\\n\\n\"There was never much in that,\" said Marjorie.\\n\\nBut with the exception of her sister\\'s, opinion was greatly in favour of\\nBrenda\\'s adventure. The morning telephone buzzed with news of her; even\\npeople with whom she had the barest acquaintance were delighted to\\nrelate that they had seen her and Beaver the evening before at a\\nrestaurant or cinema. It had been an autumn of very sparse and meagre\\nromance; only the most obvious people had parted or come together, and\\nBrenda was filling a want long felt by those whose simple, vicarious\\npleasure it was to discuss the subject in bed over the telephone. For\\nthem her circumstances shed peculiar glamour; for five years she had\\nbeen a legendary, almost ghostly name, the imprisoned princess of fairy\\nstory, and now that she had emerged there was more enchantment in the\\noccurrence than in the mere change of habit of any other circumspect\\nwife. Her very choice of partner gave the affair an appropriate touch of\\nfantasy; Beaver, the joke figure they had all known and despised,\\nsuddenly caught up to her among the luminous clouds of deity. If, after\\nseven years looking neither to right or left, she had at last broken\\naway with Jock Grant-Menzies or Robin Beaseley or any other young buck\\nwith whom nearly everyone had had a crack one time or another, it would\\nhave been thrilling no doubt, but straightforward, drawing-room comedy.\\nThe choice of Beaver raised the whole escapade into a realm of poetry\\nfor Polly and Daisy and Angela and all the gang of gossips.\\n\\nMrs Beaver made no bones about her delight. \"Of course the subject has\\nnot been mentioned between John and myself, but if what I hear is true,\\nI think it will do the boy a world of good. Of course he\\'s always been\\nvery much in demand and had a great number of friends, but _that isn\\'t\\nthe same thing_. I\\'ve felt for a long time a Lack of Something in him,\\nand I think that a charming and experienced woman like Brenda Last is\\njust the person to help him. He\\'s got a _very_ affectionate nature, but\\nhe\\'s so sensitive that he hardly ever lets it appear... to tell you the\\ntruth I felt something of the kind was in the air last week, so I made\\nan excuse to go away for a few days. If I had been there things might\\nnever have come to anything. He\\'s very shy and reserved even to me. I\\'ll\\nhave the chess-men done up and sent round to you this afternoon. Thank\\nyou so much.\"\\n\\nAnd Beaver, for the first time in his life, found himself a person of\\ninterest and, almost, of consequence. Women studied him with a new\\nscrutiny, wondering what they had missed in him; men treated him as an\\nequal, even as a successful fellow competitor. \"How on earth has _he_\\ngot away with it?\" they may have asked themselves, but now, when he came\\ninto Bratt\\'s, they made room for him at the bar and said, \"Well, old\\nboy, how about one?\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda rang up Tony every morning and evening. Sometimes John Andrew\\nspoke to her, too, as shrill as Polly Cockpurse; quite unable to hear\\nher replies. She went to Hetton for the week-end, and then back to\\nLondon, this time to the flat where the paint was already dry, though\\nthe hot water was not yet in perfect working order; everything smelt\\nvery new--walls, sheets, curtains--and the new radiators gave off a less\\nagreeable reek of hot iron.\\n\\nThat evening as usual she telephoned to Hetton. \"I\\'m talking from the\\nflat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, ah.\"\\n\\n\"_Darling_, do try to sound interested. It\\'s very exciting for me.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s it like?\"\\n\\n\"Well, there are a good many smells at present and the bath makes odd\\nsounds and when you turn on the hot tap there\\'s just a rush of air and\\nthat\\'s all, and the cold tap keeps dripping and the water is rather\\nbrown and the cupboard doors are jammed and the curtains won\\'t pull\\nright across so that the street lamp shines in all night... but it\\'s\\n_lovely_.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, you must be nice about it. It\\'s all so exciting--front door and a\\nlatch-key and all... And someone sent me a lot of flowers to-day--so\\nmany that there\\'s hardly room for them and I\\'ve had to put them in the\\nbasin on account of having no pots. It wasn\\'t you, was it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes... as a matter of fact.\"\\n\\n\"Darling, I did so hope it was... how like you.\"\\n\\n\"Three minutes, please.\"\\n\\n\"Must stop now.\"\\n\\n\"When are you coming back?\"\\n\\n\"Almost at once. Good night, my sweet.\"\\n\\n\"What a lot of talk,\" said Beaver.\\n\\nAll the time that she was speaking, she had been kept busy with one hand\\nwarding him off the telephone, which he threatened playfully to\\ndisconnect.\\n\\n\"Wasn\\'t it sweet of Tony to send those flowers?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not awfully fond of Tony.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let that worry you, my beauty, he doesn\\'t like you _at all_.\"\\n\\n\"_Doesn\\'t_ he? Why not?\"\\n\\n\"No one does except me. You must get that clear... it\\'s very odd that\\n_I_ should.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBeaver and his mother were going to Ireland for Christmas, to stay with\\ncousins. Tony and Brenda had a family party at Hetton: Marjorie and\\nAllan, Brenda\\'s mother, Tony\\'s Aunt Frances and two families of\\nimpoverished Lasts, humble and uncomplaining victims of primogeniture,\\nto whom Hetton meant as much as it did to Tony. There was a little\\nChristmas-tree in the nursery for John Andrew and a big one downstairs\\nin the central hall which was decorated by the impoverished Lasts and\\nlit up for half an hour after tea (two footmen standing by with wet\\nsponges on the end of poles, to extinguish the candles which turned\\nturtle and threatened to start a fire). There were presents for all the\\nservants, of value strictly graded according to their rank, and for all\\nthe guests (cheques for the impoverished Lasts). Allan always brought a\\nlarge cro?te of foie gras, a delicacy of which he was particularly fond.\\nEveryone ate a great deal and became slightly torpid towards Boxing-day\\nevening; silver ladles of burning brandy went round the table, crackers\\nwere pulled and opened; paper hats, indoor fireworks, mottoes. This\\nyear, everything happened in its accustomed way; nothing seemed to\\nmenace the peace and stability of the house. The choir came up and sang\\ncarols in the pitch-pine gallery, and later devoured hot punch and sweet\\nbiscuits. The vicar preached his usual Christmas sermon. It was one to\\nwhich his parishioners were greatly attached.\\n\\n\"How difficult it is for us,\" he began, blandly surveying his\\ncongregation, who coughed into their mufflers and chafed their\\nchilblains under their woollen gloves, \"to realize that this is indeed\\nChristmas. Instead of the glowing log fire and windows tight shuttered\\nagainst the drifting snow, we have only the harsh glare of an alien sun;\\ninstead of the happy circle of loved faces, of home and family, we have\\nthe uncomprehending stares of the subjugated, though no doubt grateful,\\nheathen. Instead of the placid ox and ass of Bethlehem,\" said the vicar,\\nslightly losing the thread of his comparisons, \"we have for companions\\nthe ravening tiger and the exotic camel, the furtive jackal and the\\nponderous elephant...\" And so on, through the pages of faded\\nmanuscript. The words had temporarily touched the heart of many an\\nobdurate trooper, and hearing them again, as he had heard them year\\nafter year since Mr Tendril had come to the parish, Tony and most of\\nTony\\'s guests felt that it was an integral part of their Christmas\\nfestivities; one with which they would find it very hard to dispense.\\n\"The ravening tiger and exotic camel\" had long been bywords in the\\nfamily, of frequent recurrence in all their games.\\n\\nThese games were the hardest part for Brenda. They did not amuse her and\\nshe still could not see Tony dressed up for charades without a feeling\\nof shyness. Moreover, she was tortured by the fear that any lack of\\ngusto on her part might be construed by the poor Lasts as superiority.\\nThese scruples, had she known it, were quite superfluous, for it never\\noccurred to her husband\\'s relatives to look on her with anything but\\ncousinly cordiality and a certain tolerance, for, as Lasts, they\\nconsidered they had far more right in Hetton than herself. Aunt Frances,\\nwith acid mind, quickly discerned the trouble and attempted to reassure\\nher, saying, \"Dear child, all these feelings of delicacy are valueless;\\nonly the rich realize the gulf that separates them from the poor,\" but\\nthe uneasiness persisted, and night after night she found herself being\\nsent out of the room, asking or answering questions, performing actions\\nin uncouth manners, paying forfeits, drawing pictures, writing verses,\\ndressing herself up and even being chased about the house, and secluded\\nin cupboards, at the will of her relatives. Christmas was on a Friday\\nthat year, so the party was a long one, from Thursday until Monday.\\n\\nShe had forbidden Beaver to send her a present or to write to her; in\\nself-protection, for she knew that whatever he said would hurt her by\\nits poverty, but in spite of this she awaited the posts nervously,\\nhoping that he might have disobeyed her. She had sent him to Ireland a\\nring of three interlocked hoops of gold and platinum. An hour after\\nordering it she regretted her choice. On Tuesday a letter came from him\\nthanking her. _Darling Brenda_, he wrote. _Thank you so very much for\\nthe charming Christmas present. You can imagine my delight when I saw\\nthe pink leather case and my surprise at opening it. It really was_\\nsweet _of you to send me such a charming present. Thank you again very\\nmuch for it. I hope your party is being a success. It is rather dull\\nhere. The others went hunting yesterday. I went to the meet. They did\\nnot have a good day. Mother is here too and sends her love. We shall be\\nleaving to-morrow or the day after. Mother has got rather a cold._\\n\\nIt ended there at the bottom of a page. Beaver had been writing it\\nbefore dinner and later had put it in the envelope without remembering\\nto finish it.\\n\\nHe wrote a large, school-girlish hand with wide spaces between the\\nlines.\\n\\nBrenda felt a little sick when she read this letter but she showed it to\\nMarjorie, saying, \"I can\\'t complain, he\\'s never pretended to like me\\nmuch. And anyway it was a damned silly present.\"\\n\\nTony had become fretful about his visit to Angela\\'s. He always hated\\nstaying away.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t come, darling. I\\'ll make it all right with them.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll come. I haven\\'t seen so much of you in the last three weeks.\"\\n\\nThey had the whole of Wednesday alone together. Brenda exerted herself\\nand Tony\\'s fretfulness subsided. She was particularly tender to him at\\nthis time and scarcely teased him at all.\\n\\nOn Thursday they went North to Yorkshire. Beaver was there. Tony\\ndiscovered him in the first half hour and brought the news to Brenda\\nupstairs.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you something very odd,\" he said. \"Who do you think is here?\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"Our old friend Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"Why\\'s that odd particularly?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know. I\\'d forgotten all about him, hadn\\'t you? D\\'you think\\nhe sent a telegram as he did to us?\"\\n\\n\"I daresay.\"\\n\\nTony supposed Beaver must be fairly lonely and took pains to be\\nagreeable to him. He said, \"All kinds of changes since we saw you last.\\nBrenda\\'s taken a flat in London.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know.\"\\n\\n\"How?\"\\n\\n\"Well, my mother let it to her, you know.\"\\n\\nTony was greatly surprised and taxed Brenda with this. \"You never told\\nme who was behind your flat. I might not have been so amiable if I\\'d\\nknown.\"\\n\\n\"No, darling, that\\'s why.\"\\n\\nHalf the house party wondered why Beaver was there; the other half knew.\\nAs a result of this he and Brenda saw each other very little, less than\\nif they had been casual acquaintances, so that Angela remarked to her\\nhusband, \"I daresay it was a mistake to ask him. It\\'s so hard to know.\"\\n\\nBrenda never started the subject of the half-finished letter, but she\\nnoticed that Beaver was wearing his ring, and had already acquired a\\ntrick of twisting it as he talked.\\n\\nOn New Year\\'s Eve there was a party at a neighbouring house. Tony went\\nhome early and Beaver and Brenda returned together in the back of a car.\\nNext morning, while they were having breakfast, she said to Tony, \"I\\'ve\\nmade a New Year resolution.\"\\n\\n\"Anything to do with spending more time at home?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, _quite_ the reverse. Listen, Tony, it\\'s serious. I think I\\'ll\\ntake a course of something.\"\\n\\n\"Not bone-setters again? I thought that was over.\"\\n\\n\"No, something like economics. You see, I\\'ve been thinking. I don\\'t\\nreally _do_ anything at all at present. The house runs itself. It seems\\nto me time I _took_ to something. Now you\\'re always talking about going\\ninto Parliament. Well, if I had done a course of economics I could be\\nsome use canvassing and writing speeches and things--you know, the way\\nMarjorie did when Allan was standing on the Clydeside. There are all\\nsorts of lectures in London, to do with the University, where girls go.\\nDon\\'t you think it\\'s rather a good idea?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s one better than the bone-setters,\" Tony admitted.\\n\\nThat was how the New Year began.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\nHARD CHEESE ON TONY\\n\\n\\n[I]\\n\\nIt is not uncommon at Bratt\\'s Club, between nine and ten in the\\nevening, to find men in white ties and tail coats sitting by themselves\\nand eating, in evident low spirits, large and extravagant dinners. They\\nare those who have been abandoned at the last minute by their women. For\\ntwenty minutes or so they have sat in the foyer of some restaurant,\\ngazing expectantly towards the revolving doors and alternatively taking\\nout their watches and ordering cocktails, until at length a telephone\\nmessage has been brought them that their guests are unable to come. Then\\nthey go to Bratt\\'s, half hoping to find friends but, more often than\\nnot, taking a melancholy satisfaction in finding the club deserted or\\npeopled by strangers. So they sit there, round the walls, morosely\\nregarding the mahogany tables before them, and eating and drinking\\nheavily.\\n\\nIt was in this mood and for this reason that, one evening towards the\\nmiddle of February, Jock Grant-Menzies arrived at the club.\\n\\n\"Anyone here?\"\\n\\n\"Very quiet to-night, sir. Mr Last is in the dining-room.\"\\n\\nJock found him seated in a corner; he was in day clothes; the table and\\nthe chair at his side were littered with papers and magazines; one was\\npropped up in front of him. He was half-way through dinner and\\nthree-quarters of the way through a bottle of Burgundy. \"Hullo,\" he\\nsaid. \"Chucked? Come and join me.\"\\n\\nIt was some time since Jock had seen Tony; the meeting embarrassed him\\nslightly, for like all his friends, he was wondering how Tony felt and\\nhow much he knew about Brenda and John Beaver. However, he sat down at\\nTony\\'s table.\\n\\n\"Been chucked?\" asked Tony again.\\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s the last time I ask that bitch out.\"\\n\\n\"Better have a drink. I\\'ve been drinking a whole lot. Much the best\\nthing.\"\\n\\nThey took what was left of the Burgundy and ordered another bottle.\\n\\n\"Just come up for the night,\" said Tony. \"Staying here.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got a flat now, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Well, Brenda has. There isn\\'t really room for two... we tried it once\\nand it wasn\\'t a success.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s she doing to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Out somewhere. I didn\\'t let her know I was coming... silly not to, but\\nyou see I got fed up with being alone at Hetton and thought I\\'d like to\\nsee Brenda, so I came up suddenly on the spur of the moment, just like\\nthat. Damned silly thing to do. Might have known she\\'d be going out\\nsomewhere... she\\'s very high-principled about chucking... so there it\\nis. She\\'s going to ring me up here later, if she can get away.\"\\n\\nThey drank a lot.\\n\\nTony did most of the talking. \"Extraordinary idea of hers, taking up\\neconomics,\" he said. \"I never thought it would last, but she seems\\nreally keen on it... I suppose it\\'s a good plan. You know there wasn\\'t\\nreally much for her to do all the time at Hetton. Of course she\\'d rather\\ndie than admit it, but I believe she got a bit bored there sometimes.\\nI\\'ve been thinking it over and that\\'s the conclusion I came to. Brenda\\nmust have been bored... Daresay she\\'ll get bored with economics some\\ntime... Anyway, she seems cheerful enough now. We\\'ve had parties every\\nweek-end lately... I wish you\\'d come down sometimes, Jock. I don\\'t seem\\nto get on with Brenda\\'s new friends.\"\\n\\n\"People from the school of economics?\"\\n\\n\"No, but ones I don\\'t know. I believe I bore them. Thinking it over,\\nthat\\'s the conclusion I\\'ve come to. I bore them. They talk about me as\\n\"the old boy\". John heard them.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s friendly enough.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s friendly.\"\\n\\nThey finished the Burgundy and drank some port. Presently Tony said, \"I\\nsay, come next week-end, will you?\"\\n\\n\"I think I\\'d love to.\"\\n\\n\"Wish you would. I don\\'t see many old friends... Sure to be lots of\\npeople in the house, but you won\\'t mind that, will you?... sociable\\nchap, Jock... doesn\\'t mind people about. _I_ mind it like hell.\" They\\ndrank some more port. Tony said, \"Not enough bathrooms, you know... but\\nof course you know. You\\'ve been there before, often. Not like the new\\nfriends who think me a bore. You don\\'t think I\\'m a bore, do you?\"\\n\\n\"No, old boy.\"\\n\\n\"Not even when I\\'m tight, like this?... There would have been\\nbathrooms. I had the plans out. Four new ones. A chap down there made\\nthe plans... but then Brenda wanted the flat so I had to postpone them\\nas an economy... I say, that\\'s funny. We had to economize because of\\nBrenda\\'s economics.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s funny. Let\\'s have some port.\"\\n\\nTony said, \"You seem pretty low to-night.\"\\n\\n\"I am rather. Worried about the Pig Scheme. Constituents keep writing.\"\\n\\n\"_I_ felt low, _bloody_ low, but I\\'m all right again now. The best thing\\nis to get tight. That\\'s what I did and I don\\'t feel low any more...\\ndiscouraging to come to London and find you\\'re not wanted. Funny thing,\\n_you_ feel low because your girl\\'s chucked, and _I_ feel low because\\nmine won\\'t chuck.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s funny.\"\\n\\n\"But you know I\\'ve felt low for weeks now... bloody low... how about\\nsome brandy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, why not? After all, there are other things in life besides women\\nand pigs.\"\\n\\nThey had some brandy and after a time Jock began to cheer up.\\n\\nPresently a page came to their table to say, \"A message from Lady\\nBrenda, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Good, I\\'ll go and speak to her.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not her ladyship speaking. Someone was sending a message.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come and speak to her.\"\\n\\nHe went to the telephone in the lobby outside. \"Darling,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Is that Mr Last? I\\'ve got a message here, from Lady Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"Right, put me through to her.\"\\n\\n\"She can\\'t speak herself, but she asked me to give you this message,\\nthat she\\'s very sorry but she cannot join you to-night. She\\'s very tired\\nand has gone home to bed.\"\\n\\n\"Tell her I want to speak to her.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, I\\'m afraid, she\\'s gone to bed. She\\'s very tired.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s very tired and she\\'s gone to bed?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I want to speak to her.\"\\n\\n\"Good night,\" said the voice.\\n\\n\"The old boy\\'s plastered,\" said Beaver as he rang off.\\n\\n\"Oh dear. I feel rather awful about him. But what _can_ he expect,\\ncoming up suddenly like this? He\\'s got to be taught not to make surprise\\nvisits.\"\\n\\n\"Is he often like that?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s quite new.\"\\n\\nThe telephone bell rang. \"D\\'you suppose that\\'s him again? I\\'d better\\nanswer it.\"\\n\\n\"I want to speak to Lady Brenda Last.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, darling, this _is_ me, Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"Some damn fool said I couldn\\'t speak to you.\"\\n\\n\"I left a message from where I was dining. Are you having a lovely\\nevening?\"\\n\\n\"Hellish. I\\'m with Jock. He\\'s worried about the Pig Scheme. Shall we\\ncome round and see you?\"\\n\\n\"No, not now, darling, I\\'m terribly tired and just going to bed.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll come and see you.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, are you a tiny bit tight?\"\\n\\n\"Stinking. Jock and I\\'ll come and see you.\"\\n\\n\"_Tony_, you\\'re _not_ to. D\\'you hear? I can\\'t have you making a brawl.\\nThe flats are getting a bad name anyhow.\"\\n\\n\"Their name\\'ll be mud when Jock and I come.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, listen, will you please not come, not to-night. Be a good boy and\\nstay at the club. Will you _please_ not?\"\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t be long.\" He rang off.\\n\\n\"Oh God,\" said Brenda. \"This isn\\'t the least like Tony. Ring up Bratt\\'s\\nand get on to Jock. He\\'ll have more sense.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"That was Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"So I gathered.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s at the flat. I said that we\\'d go round.\"\\n\\n\"Splendid. Haven\\'t seen her for weeks. Very fond of Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"So am I. Grand girl.\"\\n\\n\"Grand girl.\"\\n\\n\"A lady on the telephone for you, Mr Grant-Menzies.\"\\n\\n\"Who?\"\\n\\n\"She didn\\'t give a name.\"\\n\\n\"All right. I\\'ll come.\"\\n\\nBrenda said to him, \"Jock, what _have_ you been doing to my husband?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a bit tight, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s roaring. Look here, he threatens to come round. I simply can\\'t\\nface him to-night in that mood, I\\'m tired out. You understand, don\\'t\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\\n\\n\"So will you, _please_, keep him away? Are you tight too?\"\\n\\n\"A little bit.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, can I trust you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it doesn\\'t sound too good. Good-bye... John, you\\'ve got to go.\\nThose hooligans may turn up at any moment. Have you got your taxi fare?\\nYou\\'ll find some change in my bag.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Was that your girl?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Made it up?\"\\n\\n\"Not exactly.\"\\n\\n\"Far better to make it up. Shall we have some more brandy or go round to\\nBrenda straight away?\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s have some more brandy.\"\\n\\n\"Jock, you aren\\'t still feeling low, are you? Doesn\\'t do to feel low.\\n_I\\'m_ not feeling low. I _was_, but I\\'m not any more.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not feeling low.\"\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll have some brandy and then go to Brenda\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"All right.\"\\n\\nHalf an hour later they got into Jock\\'s car. \"Tell you what, I shouldn\\'t\\ndrive if I were you.\"\\n\\n\"Not drive?\"\\n\\n\"No, I shouldn\\'t drive. They\\'d say you were drunk.\"\\n\\n\"Who would?\"\\n\\n\"Anyone you ran over. They\\'d say you were drunk.\"\\n\\n\"Well, so I am.\"\\n\\n\"Then I shouldn\\'t drive.\"\\n\\n\"Too far to walk.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll take a taxi.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, hell, I can drive.\"\\n\\n\"Or let\\'s not go to Brenda\\'s at all.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'d better go to Brenda\\'s,\" said Jock. \"She\\'s expecting us.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can\\'t walk all that way. Besides, I don\\'t think she really\\nwanted us to come.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'ll be pleased when she sees us.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but it\\'s a long way. Let\\'s go some other place.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see Brenda,\" said Jock. \"I\\'m very fond of Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s a grand girl.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s a grand girl.\"\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s take a taxi to Brenda\\'s.\"\\n\\nBut half-way Jock said, \"Don\\'t let\\'s go there. Let\\'s go some other\\nplace. Let\\'s go to some low joint.\"\\n\\n\"All the same to me. Tell him to go to some lousy joint.\"\\n\\n\"Go to some lousy joint,\" said Jock, putting his head through the\\nwindow.\\n\\nThe cab wheeled round and made towards Regent Street.\\n\\n\"We can always ring Brenda from the lousy joint.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I think we ought to do that. She\\'s a grand girl.\"\\n\\n\"Grand girl.\"\\n\\nThe cab turned into Golden Square and then down Sink Street, a dingy\\nlittle place inhabited for the most part by Asiatics.\\n\\n\"D\\'you know, I believe he\\'s taking us to the Old Hundredth.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t still be open? Thought they closed it down years ago.\"\\n\\nBut the door was brightly illuminated and a seedy figure in peaked cap\\nand braided overcoat stepped out to open the taxi for them.\\n\\nThe Old Hundredth has never been shut. For a generation, while other\\nnight clubs have sprung into being, with various names and managers, and\\nvarious pretensions to respectability, have enjoyed a precarious and\\nbrief existence, and come to grief at the hands either of police or\\ncreditors, the Old Hundredth has maintained a solid front against all\\nadversity. It has not been immune from persecution; far from it. Times\\nout of number, magistrates have struck it off, cancelled its licence,\\ncondemned its premises; the staff and proprietor have been constantly in\\nand out of prison; there have been questions in the House and committees\\nof enquiry, but whatever Home Secretaries and Commissioners of Police\\nhave risen into eminence and retired discredited, the doors of the Old\\nHundredth have always been open from nine in the evening until four at\\nnight, and inside there has been an unimpeded flow of dubious, alcoholic\\npreparations. A kindly young lady admitted Tony and Jock to the\\nramshackle building.\\n\\n\"D\\'you mind signing on?\" Tony and Jock inscribed fictitious names at the\\nfoot of a form which stated, _I have been invited to a Bottle Party at\\n100 Sink Street given by Captain Weybridge_. \"That\\'s five bob each,\\nplease.\"\\n\\nIt is not an expensive club to run, because none of the staff, except\\nthe band, receive any wages; they make what they can by going through\\nthe overcoat pockets and giving the wrong change to drunks. The young\\nladies get in free but they have to see to it that their patrons spend\\nmoney.\\n\\n\"Last time I was here, Tony, was the bachelor party before your\\nwedding.\"\\n\\n\"Tight that night.\"\\n\\n\"Stinking.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you who else was tight that night--Reggie. Broke a fruit gum\\nmachine.\"\\n\\n\"Reggie was stinking.\"\\n\\n\"I say, you don\\'t still feel low about that girl?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t feel low.\"\\n\\n\"Come on, we\\'ll go downstairs.\"\\n\\nThe dance-room was fairly full. An elderly man had joined the band and\\nwas trying to conduct it. \"I like this joint,\" said Jock. \"What\\'ll we\\ndrink?\"\\n\\n\"Brandy.\"\\n\\nThey had to buy the bottle. They filled in an order form to the\\nMontmorency Wine Company and paid two pounds. When it came there was a\\nlabel saying _Very Old Liqueur Fine Champagne. Imported by the\\nMontmorency Wine Co._ The waiter brought ginger ale and four glasses.\\nTwo young ladies came and sat with them. They were called Milly and\\nBabs. Milly said, \"Are you in town for long?\" Babs said, \"Have you got\\nsuch a thing as a cigarette?\"\\n\\nTony danced with Babs. She said, \"Are you fond of dancing?\"\\n\\n\"No, are you?\"\\n\\n\"So-so.\"\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s sit down.\"\\n\\nThe waiter said, \"Will you buy a ticket in a raffle for a box of\\nchocolates?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Buy one for me,\" said Babs.\\n\\nJock began to describe the specifications of the Basic Pig.\\n\\n...Milly said, \"You\\'re married, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Jock.\\n\\n\"Oh, I can always tell,\" said Milly. \"Your friend is too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, _he_ is.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d be surprised how many gentlemen come here just to talk about\\ntheir wives.\"\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t.\"\\n\\nTony was leaning across the table and saying to Babs, \"You see, the\\ntrouble is my wife is studious. She\\'s taking a course in economics.\"\\n\\nBabs said, \"I think it\\'s nice for a girl to be interested in things.\"\\n\\nThe waiter said, \"What will you be taking for supper?\"\\n\\n\"Why, we\\'ve only just had dinner.\"\\n\\n\"How about a nice haddock?\"\\n\\n\"I tell you what I must do is to telephone. Where is it?\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you mean really the telephone or the gentlemen\\'s?\" Milly asked.\\n\\n\"No, the telephone.\"\\n\\n\"Upstairs in the office.\"\\n\\nTony rang up Brenda. It was some time before she answered, then, \"Yes,\\nwho is it?\"\\n\\n\"I have a message here from Mr Anthony Last and Mr Jocelyn\\nGrant-Menzies.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you, Tony. Well, what do you want?\"\\n\\n\"You recognized my voice?\"\\n\\n\"I did.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I only wanted to give a message but as I am speaking to you I can\\ngive it myself, can\\'t I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Jock and I are terribly sorry but we can\\'t come round this\\nevening after all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t think it very rude, I hope, but we have a lot to attend to.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, Tony.\"\\n\\n\"Did I wake you up by any chance?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, Tony.\"\\n\\n\"Well, good night.\"\\n\\nTony went down to the table. \"I\\'ve been talking to Brenda. She sounded\\nrather annoyed. D\\'you think we _ought_ to go round there?\"\\n\\n\"We promised we would,\" said Jock.\\n\\n\"You should never disappoint a lady,\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s too late now.\"\\n\\nBabs said, \"You two are officers, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"No, why?\"\\n\\n\"I thought you were.\"\\n\\nMilly said, \"I like business gentlemen best, myself. They\\'ve more to\\nsay.\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you do?\"\\n\\n\"I design postmen\\'s hats,\" said Jock.\\n\\n\"Oh, go on.\"\\n\\n\"And my friend here trains sea-lions.\"\\n\\n\"Tell us another.\"\\n\\nBabs said, \"I\\'ve got a gentleman friend who works on a newspaper.\"\\n\\nAfter a time Jock said, \"I say, ought we to do something about Brenda?\"\\n\\n\"I told her we weren\\'t coming, didn\\'t I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes... but she might still be _hoping_.\"\\n\\n\"I tell you what, you go and ring her up and find out if she really\\nwants us.\"\\n\\n\"All right.\" He came back ten minutes later. \"_I_ thought she sounded\\nrather annoyed,\" he reported. \"But I said in the end we wouldn\\'t come.\"\\n\\n\"She may be tired,\" said Tony. \"Has to get up early to do economics. Now\\nI come to think of it someone _did_ say she was tired, earlier on in the\\nevening.\"\\n\\n\"I say, what\\'s this frightful piece of fish?\"\\n\\n\"The waiter said you ordered it.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I did.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give it to the club cat,\" said Babs. \"She\\'s a dear called\\nBlackberry.\"\\n\\nThey danced once or twice. Then Jock said, \"D\\'you think we ought to ring\\nup Brenda again?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps we ought. She sounded annoyed with us.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go now and ring her up on the way out.\"\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you coming home with us?\" said Babs.\\n\\n\"Not to-night, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Be a sport,\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"No, we can\\'t really.\"\\n\\n\"All right. Well, how about a little present? We\\'re professional dancing\\npartners, you know,\" said Babs.\\n\\n\"Oh yes, sorry, how much?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we leave that to the gentlemen.\"\\n\\nTony gave them a pound. \"You might make it a bit more,\" said Babs.\\n\"We\\'ve sat with you two hours.\"\\n\\nJock gave another pound. \"Come and see us again one evening when you\\'ve\\ngot more time,\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m feeling rather ill,\" said Tony on the way upstairs. \"Don\\'t think I\\nshall bother to ring up Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"Send a message.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good idea... Look here,\" he said to the seedy commissionaire.\\n\"Will you ring up this Sloane number and speak to her ladyship and say\\nMr Grant-Menzies and Mr Last are very sorry but they cannot call this\\nevening? Got that?\" He gave the man half a crown and they sauntered out\\ninto Sink Street. \"Brenda can\\'t expect us to do more than that,\" he\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"I tell you what I\\'ll do. I go almost past her door, so I\\'ll ring the\\nbell a bit just in case she\\'s awake and still waiting up for us.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you do that. What a good friend you are, Jock.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m fond of Brenda... a grand girl.\"\\n\\n\"Grand girl... I wish I didn\\'t feel ill.\"\\n\\nTony was awake at eight next morning, miserably articulating in his mind\\nthe fragmentary memories of the preceding night. The more he remembered,\\nthe baser his conduct appeared to him. At nine he had his bath and some\\ntea. At ten he was wondering whether he should ring Brenda up when the\\ndifficulty was solved by her ringing him.\\n\\n\"Well, Tony, how do you feel?\"\\n\\n\"Awful. I _was_ tight.\"\\n\\n\"You were.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m feeling pretty guilty too.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not surprised.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember everything very clearly but I have the impression that\\nJock and I were rather bores.\"\\n\\n\"You were.\"\\n\\n\"Are you in a rage?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I was last night. What made you do it, Tony, grown up men like\\nyou two?\"\\n\\n\"We felt low.\"\\n\\n\"I bet you feel lower this morning... A box of white roses has just\\narrived from Jock.\"\\n\\n\"I wish I\\'d thought of that.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re such infants, both of you.\"\\n\\n\"You aren\\'t really in a rage?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I\\'m not, darling. Now just you go straight back to the\\ncountry. You\\'ll feel all right again to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Am I not going to see you?\"\\n\\n\"Not to-day, I\\'m afraid. I\\'ve got lectures all the morning and I\\'m\\nlunching out. But I\\'ll be coming down on Friday evening or anyway\\nSaturday morning.\"\\n\\n\"I see. You couldn\\'t possibly chuck lunch or one of the lectures?\"\\n\\n\"Not possibly, darling.\"\\n\\n\"I see. You are an angel to be so sweet about last night.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing could have been more fortunate,\" Brenda said. \"If I know Tony,\\nhe\\'ll be tortured with guilt for weeks to come. It was maddening last\\nnight but it was worth it. He\\'s put himself so much in the wrong now\\nthat he won\\'t dare to _feel_ resentful, let alone say anything, whatever\\nI do. And he hasn\\'t really enjoyed himself at all, the poor sweet, so\\n_that\\'s_ a good thing too. He had to learn not to make surprise visits.\"\\n\\n\"You are one for making people learn things,\" said Beaver.\\n\\nTony emerged from the 3.18 feeling cold, tired, and heavy with guilt.\\nJohn Andrew had come in the car to meet him. \"Hullo, daddy, had a good\\ntime in London? You didn\\'t mind me coming to the station, did you? I\\n_made_ nanny let me.\"\\n\\n\"Very pleased to see you, John.\"\\n\\n\"How was mummy?\"\\n\\n\"She sounded very well. I didn\\'t see her.\"\\n\\n\"But you _said_ you were going to see her.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I thought I was, but I turned out to be wrong. I talked to her\\nseveral times on the telephone.\"\\n\\n\"But you can telephone her from here, can\\'t you, daddy? Why did you go\\nall the way to London to telephone her?... _Why_, daddy?\"\\n\\n\"It would take too long to explain.\"\\n\\n\"Well tell me some of it... _Why_, daddy?\"\\n\\n\"Look here, I\\'m tired. If you don\\'t stop asking questions I shan\\'t let\\nyou ever come and meet the train again.\"\\n\\nJohn Andrew\\'s face began to pucker. \"I thought you\\'d _like_ me to come\\nand meet you.\"\\n\\n\"If you cry I shall put you in front with Dawson. It\\'s absurd to cry at\\nyour age.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d _sooner_ go in front with Dawson,\" said John Andrew between his\\ntears.\\n\\nTony picked up the speaking-tube to tell the chauffeur to stop, but he\\ncould not make him hear. So he hitched the mouthpiece back on its hook\\nand they drove on in silence, John Andrew leaning against the window and\\nsnivelling slightly. When they got to the house he said, \"Nanny, I don\\'t\\nwant John to come to the station in future unless her ladyship or I\\nspecially say he can.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, I wouldn\\'t have let him go to-day, only he went on so. Come\\nalong now, John, and take off your coat. Goodness, child, where\\'s your\\nhandkerchief?\"\\n\\nTony went and sat alone in front of the library fire. \"Two men of\\nthirty,\" he said to himself, \"behaving as if they were up for the night\\nfrom Sandhurst--getting drunk and ringing people up and dancing with\\ntarts at the Old Hundredth... And it makes it all the worse that Brenda\\nwas so nice about it.\" He dozed a little; then he went up to change. At\\ndinner he said, \"Ambrose, when I\\'m alone I think in future I\\'ll have\\ndinner in the library.\" Afterwards he sat with a book in front of the\\nfire but he was unable to read. At ten o\\'clock he scattered the logs in\\nthe fireplace before going upstairs. He fastened the library windows and\\nturned out the lights. That night he went into Brenda\\'s empty room to\\nsleep.\\n\\n[II]\\n\\nThat was Wednesday; on Thursday Tony felt well again. He had a meeting\\nof the county council in the morning. In the afternoon he went down to\\nthe home farm and discussed a new kind of tractor with his agent. From\\nthen onwards he was able to say to himself, \"This time to-morrow Brenda\\nand Jock will be here.\" He dined in front of the fire in the library. He\\nhad given up the diet some weeks ago. (\"Ambrose, when I\\'m alone I don\\'t\\nreally need a long dinner. In future I\\'ll just have two courses.\") He\\nlooked over some accounts his agent had left for him and then went to\\nbed, saying to himself, \"When I wake up it will be the week-end.\"\\n\\nBut there was a telegram for him next morning from Jock, saying, _Week\\nend impossible have to go to constituency how about one after next_. He\\nwired back, _Delighted any time always here_. \"I suppose he\\'s made it up\\nwith that girl,\" Tony reflected.\\n\\nThere was also a note from Brenda, written in pencil:\\n\\n    Coming Sat. with Polly and a friend of Polly\\'s called Veronica\\n    in P.\\'s car. Perhaps Daisy Maids and luggage on 3.18. Will you\\n    tell Ambrose and Mrs Mossop. We had better open Lyonesse for\\n    Polly you know what she is about comfort. Veronica can go\\n    anywhere--not Galahad. Polly says she\\'s v. amusing. Also Mrs\\n    Beaver coming, please don\\'t mind it is only on business, she\\n    thinks she can do something to morning-room. Polly bringing\\n    chauffeur. By the way I\\'m leaving Grimshawe at Hetton next week\\n    tell Mrs Mossop. It\\'s a bore and expense boarding her out in\\n    London. In fact I think I might do without her altogether, what\\n    do you think; except she\\'s useful for sewing. Longing to see\\n    John again. All going back Sunday evening. Keep _sober_,\\n    darling. _Try._\\n\\n    x x x x x x\\n\\n    B.\\n\\nTony found very little to occupy his time on Friday. His letters were\\nall finished by ten o\\'clock. He went down to the farm but they had no\\nbusiness for him there. The duties which before had seemed so\\nmultifarious, now took up a very small part of his day; he had not\\nrealized how many hours he used to waste with Brenda. He watched John\\nriding in the paddock. The boy clearly bore him ill will for their\\nquarrel on Wednesday; when he applauded a jump, John said, \"She usually\\ndoes better than this.\" Later, \"When\\'s mummy coming down?\"\\n\\n\"Not till to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to go over to Little Bayton this afternoon. Would you like to\\ncome too and perhaps we could see the kennels?\"\\n\\nJohn had for weeks past been praying for this expedition. \"No, thank\\nyou,\" he said. \"I want to finish a picture I\\'m painting.\"\\n\\n\"You can do that any time.\"\\n\\n\"I want to do it this afternoon.\"\\n\\nWhen Tony had left them, Ben said, \"Whatever made you speak to your dad\\nlike that for? You\\'ve been going on about seeing the kennels since\\nChristmas.\"\\n\\n\"Not with _him_,\" said John.\\n\\n\"You ungrateful little bastard, that\\'s a lousy way to speak of your\\ndad.\"\\n\\n\"And you ought not to say bastard or lousy in front of me, nanny says\\nnot.\"\\n\\nSo Tony went over alone to Little Bayton, where he had some business to\\ndiscuss with Colonel Brink. He hoped they would ask him to stay on, but\\nthe Colonel and his wife were themselves going out to tea, so he drove\\nback in the dusk to Hetton.\\n\\nA thin mist lay breast-high over the park; the turrets and battlements\\nof the abbey stood grey and flat; the boiler man was hauling down the\\nflag on the main tower.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"My poor Brenda, it\\'s an appalling room,\" said Mrs Beaver.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not one we use a great deal,\" said Tony very coldly.\\n\\n\"I should think not,\" said the one they called Veronica.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see much wrong with it,\" said Polly, \"except it\\'s a bit\\nmouldy.\"\\n\\n\"You see,\" Brenda explained, not looking at Tony. \"What I thought was\\nthat I must have _one_ habitable room downstairs. At present there\\'s\\nonly the smoking-room and the library. The drawing-room is vast and\\nquite out of the question. I thought what I needed was a small\\nsitting-room more or less to myself. Don\\'t you think it has\\npossibilities?\"\\n\\n\"But, my angel, the _shape\\'s_ all wrong,\" said Daisy, \"and that\\nchimney-piece--what is it made of, pink granite, and all the plaster\\nwork and the dado. _Everything\\'s_ horrible. It\\'s so _dark_.\"\\n\\n\"I know exactly what Brenda wants,\" said Mrs Beaver more moderately. \"I\\ndon\\'t think it will be impossible. I must think about it. As Veronica\\nsays, the structure does rather limit one... you know, I think the only\\nthing to do would be to disregard it altogether and find some treatment\\nso definite that it _carried_ the room, if you see what I mean...\\nsupposing we covered the walls with white chromium plating and had\\nnatural sheepskin carpet... I wonder if that would be running you in\\nfor more than you meant to spend?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d blow the whole thing sky-high,\" said Veronica.\\n\\nTony left them to their discussion.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"D\\'you really want Mrs Beaver to do up the morning-room?\"\\n\\n\"Not if you don\\'t, sweet.\"\\n\\n\"But can you imagine it--white chromium plating?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that was just an idea.\"\\n\\nTony walked in and out between Morgan le Fay and Guinevere as he always\\ndid while they were dressing. \"I say,\" he said, returning with his\\nwaistcoat. \"You aren\\'t going away to-morrow too, are you?\"\\n\\n\"Must.\"\\n\\nHe went back to Morgan le Fay for his tie and bringing it to Brenda\\'s\\nroom again, sat by her side at the dressing table to fasten it.\\n\\n\"By the way,\" said Brenda, \"what did you think about keeping on\\nGrimshawe?--it seems rather a waste.\"\\n\\n\"You used always to say you couldn\\'t get on without her.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but now I\\'m living at the flat everything\\'s so simple.\"\\n\\n\"_Living?_ Darling, you talk as though you had settled there for good.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you mind moving a second, sweet? I can\\'t see properly.\"\\n\\n\"Brenda, how long are you going on with this course of economics?\"\\n\\n\"Me? I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"But you must have some idea?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s surprising what a lot there is to learn... I was so backward\\nwhen I started...\"\\n\\n\"Brenda...\"\\n\\n\"Now run and put on your coat. They\\'ll all be downstairs waiting for\\nus.\"\\n\\nThat evening Polly and Mrs Beaver played backgammon. Brenda and Veronica\\nsat together on the sofa sewing and talking about their needlework;\\noccasionally there were bursts of general conversation between the\\nwomen; they had the habit of lapsing into a jargon of their own which\\nTony did not understand; it was a thieves\\' slang, by which the syllables\\nof each word were transposed. Tony sat just outside the circle reading\\nunder another lamp.\\n\\nThat night when they went upstairs, the guests came to sit in Brenda\\'s\\nroom and talk to her while she went to bed. Tony could hear their low\\nlaughter through the dressing-room door. They had boiled water in an\\nelectric kettle and were drinking Sedobrol together.\\n\\nPresently, still laughing, they left, and Tony went into Brenda\\'s room.\\nIt was in darkness but hearing him come and seeing the square of light\\nin the doorway she turned on the little lamp by the bedside.\\n\\n\"Why, Tony,\" she said.\\n\\nShe was lying on the dais with her head deep back in the pillow; her\\nface was shining with the grease she used for cleaning it; one bare arm\\non the quilted eiderdown, left there from turning the switch. \"Why,\\nTony,\" she said, \"I was almost asleep.\"\\n\\n\"Very tired?\"\\n\\n\"Mm.\"\\n\\n\"Want to be left alone?\"\\n\\n\"So tired... and I\\'ve just drunk a lot of that stuff of Polly\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"I see... well, good night.\"\\n\\n\"Good night... don\\'t mind, do you?... so tired.\"\\n\\nHe crossed to the bed and kissed her; she lay quite still, with closed\\neyes. Then he turned out the light and went back to the dressing-room.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Lady Brenda not ill, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"No, nothing serious, thank you very much. She gets rather done up in\\nLondon, you know, during the week, and likes to take Sunday quietly.\"\\n\\n\"And how are the great studies progressing?\"\\n\\n\"Very well, I gather. She seems keen on it still.\"\\n\\n\"Splendid. We shall all be coming to her soon to solve our economic\\nproblems. But I daresay you and John miss her?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we do rather.\"\\n\\n\"Well, please give her my kindest regards.\"\\n\\n\"I will indeed. Thank you so much.\"\\n\\nTony left the church porch and made his accustomed way to the hothouses;\\na gardenia for himself; some almost black carnations for the ladies.\\nWhen he reached the room where they were sitting there was a burst of\\nlaughter. He paused on the threshold, rather bewildered.\\n\\n\"Come in, darling, it isn\\'t anything. It\\'s only we had a bet on what\\ncoloured buttonhole you\\'d be wearing and none of us won.\"\\n\\nThey still giggled a little as they pinned on the flowers he had brought\\nthem; all except Mrs Beaver, who said, \"Any time you are buying cuttings\\nor seeds do get them through me. I\\'ve made quite a little business of\\nit, perhaps you didn\\'t know... all kinds of rather unusual flowers. I\\ndo everything like that for Sylvia Newport and all sorts of people.\"\\n\\n\"You must talk to my head man about it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, to tell you the truth I _have_--this morning while you were in\\nchurch. He seems quite to understand.\"\\n\\nThey left early, so as to reach London in time for dinner. In the car\\nDaisy said, \"Golly, what a house.\"\\n\\n\"Now you can see what I\\'ve been through all these years.\"\\n\\n\"My poor Brenda,\" said Veronica, unpinning her carnation and throwing it\\nfrom the window into the side of the road.\\n\\n\"You know,\" Brenda confided next day, \"I\\'m not _absolutely_ happy about\\nTony.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the old boy been up to?\" asked Polly.\\n\\n\"Nothing much yet, but I do see it\\'s pretty boring for him at Hetton all\\nthis time.\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t worry.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not _worrying_. It\\'s only, supposing he took to drink or\\nsomething. It would make everything very difficult.\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have said that was his thing... We must get him interested\\nin a girl.\"\\n\\n\"If only we could... Who is there?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s always old Sybil.\"\\n\\n\"Darling, he\\'s known her all his life.\"\\n\\n\"Or Souki de Foucauld-Esterhazy.\"\\n\\n\"He isn\\'t his best with Americans.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll find him someone.\"\\n\\n\"The trouble is that I\\'ve become such a habit with him--he won\\'t take\\neasily to a new one... ought she to be like me, or quite different?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d say different, but it\\'s hard to tell.\"\\n\\nThey discussed this problem in all its aspects.\\n\\n\\n[III]\\n\\nBrenda wrote:\\n\\n    Darling Tony,\\n\\n    Sorry not to have written or rung up but I\\'ve had such a busy\\n    time with bimetallism. V. complicated.\\n\\n    Coming down Saturday with Polly again. Good her coming\\n    twice--Lyonesse can\\'t be as beastly as most of the rooms, can\\n    it.\\n\\n    Also charming girl I have taken up with who I want us to be kind\\n    to. She\\'s had a _terrible_ life and she lives in one of these\\n    flats, called Jenny Abdul Akbar. Not black but married one. Get\\n    her to tell you. She\\'ll come by train 3.18 I expect. Must stop\\n    now and go to lecture.\\n\\n    Keep away from the Demon Rum.\\n\\n    x x x x x x\\n\\n    Brenda.\\n\\n    Saw Jock last night at Caf? de Paris with shameless blonde. Who?\\n\\n    Gin. No, Djin--how?--has rheumatism and Marjorie is v. put out\\n    about it. She thinks his pelvis is out of place and Cruttwell\\n    won\\'t do him which is pretty mean considering all the people she\\n    has brought there.\\n\\n\"Are you _certain_ Jenny will be Tony\\'s tea?\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t ever be certain,\" said Polly. \"She bores my pants off, but\\nshe\\'s a good trier.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Is mummy coming down to-day, daddy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Who else?\"\\n\\n\"Someone called Jenny Abdul Akbar.\"\\n\\n\"What a silly name. Is she foreign?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Sounds foreign, doesn\\'t she, daddy? D\\'you think she won\\'t be able to\\ntalk any English? Is she black?\"\\n\\n\"Mummy says not.\"\\n\\n\"Oh... who else?\"\\n\\n\"Lady Cockpurse.\"\\n\\n\"The monkey-woman. You know she wasn\\'t a bit like a monkey except\\nperhaps her face and I don\\'t think she had a tail because I looked as\\nclose as anything... unless perhaps she has it rolled up between her\\nlegs. D\\'you think she has, daddy?\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be surprised.\"\\n\\n\"_Very_ uncomfortable.\"\\n\\nTony and John were friends again; but it had been a leaden week.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nIt was part of Polly Cockpurse\\'s plan to arrive late at Hetton. \"Give\\nthe girl a chance to get down to it,\" she said. So she and Brenda did\\nnot leave London until Jenny was already on her way from the station. It\\nwas a day of bitter cold and occasional rain. The resolute little figure\\nhuddled herself in the rugs until she reached the gates. Then she opened\\nher bag, tucked up her veil, shook out her powder puff and put her face\\nto rights. She licked the rouge from her finger with a sharp red tongue.\\n\\nTony was in the smoking-room when she was announced; the library was now\\ntoo noisy during the daytime, for there were men at work on the walls of\\nthe morning-room next door, tearing down the plaster tracery.\\n\\n\"Princess Abdul Akbar.\"\\n\\nHe rose to greet her. She was preceded by a heavy odour of musk.\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr Last,\" she said, \"what a sweet old place this is.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it\\'s been restored a great deal,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"Ah, but its _atmosphere_. I always think that\\'s what counts in a house.\\nSuch dignity, and repose. But of course you\\'re used to it. When you\\'ve\\nbeen very unhappy as I have, you appreciate these things.\"\\n\\nTony said, \"I\\'m afraid Brenda hasn\\'t arrived yet. She\\'s coming by car\\nwith Lady Cockpurse.\"\\n\\n\"Brenda\\'s been _such_ a friend to me.\" The Princess took off her furs\\nand sat down on the stool before the fire, looking up at Tony. \"D\\'you\\nmind if I take off my hat?\"\\n\\n\"No, no... of course.\"\\n\\nShe threw it on to the sofa and shook out her hair, which was dead black\\nand curled. \"D\\'you know, Mr Last, I\\'m going to call you Teddy right\\naway. You don\\'t think that very fresh of me? And you must call me Jenny.\\n\"Princess\" is so formal, isn\\'t it, and suggests tight trousers and gold\\nbraid... Of course,\" she went on, stretching out her hands to the fire\\nand letting her hair fall forwards a little across her face, \"my husband\\nwas not called \"Prince\" in Morocco; his title was Moulay--but there\\'s no\\nproper equivalent for a woman, so I\\'ve always called myself Princess in\\nEurope... Moulay is _far_ higher really... my husband was a descendant\\nof the Prophet. Are you interested in the East?\"\\n\\n\"No... yes. I mean I know very little about it.\"\\n\\n\"It has an uncanny fascination for me. You must go there, Teddy. I know\\nyou\\'d like it. I\\'ve been saying the same to Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"I expect you\\'d like to see your room,\" said Tony. \"They\\'ll bring tea\\nsoon.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll stay here. I like just to curl up like a cat in front of the\\nfire, and if you\\'re nice to me I\\'ll purr, and if you\\'re cruel I shall\\npretend not to notice--just like a cat... Shall I purr, Teddy?\"\\n\\n\"Er... yes... do, please, if that\\'s what you like doing.\"\\n\\n\"Englishmen are so gentle and considerate. It\\'s wonderful to be back\\namong them... mine own people. Sometimes when I look back at my life,\\nespecially at times like this, among lovely old English things and kind\\npeople, I think the whole thing must be a frightful nightmare... then I\\nremember my _scars_...\"\\n\\n\"Brenda tells me you\\'ve taken one of the flats in the same house as\\nhers. They must be very convenient.\"\\n\\n\"How English you are, Teddy--so shy of talking about personal things,\\nintimate things... I like you for that, you know. I love everything\\nthat\\'s solid and homely and _good_ after... after all I\\'ve been\\nthrough.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re not studying economics too, are you, like Brenda?\"\\n\\n\"No; is Brenda? She never told me. What a wonderful person she is. When\\n_does_ she find the time?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, here comes tea at last,\" said Tony. \"I hope you allow yourself to\\neat muffins. So many of our guests nowadays are on a diet. I think\\nmuffins one of the few things that make the English winter endurable.\"\\n\\n\"Muffins stand for so much,\" said Jenny.\\n\\nShe ate heartily; often she ran her tongue over her lips, collecting\\ncrumbs that had become embedded there and melted butter from the muffin.\\nOne drop of butter fell on her chin and glittered there unobserved\\nexcept by Tony. It was a relief to him when John Andrew was brought in.\\n\\n\"Come and be introduced to Princess Abdul Akbar.\"\\n\\nJohn Andrew had never before seen a Princess; he gazed at her,\\nfascinated.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you going to give me a kiss?\"\\n\\nHe walked over to her and she kissed him on the mouth.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" he said, recoiling and rubbing away the taste of the lipstick; and\\nthen, \"What a beautiful smell.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my last link with the East,\" she said.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got butter on your chin.\"\\n\\nShe reached for her bag, laughing. \"Why, so I have. Teddy, you _might_\\nhave told me.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you call daddy Teddy?\"\\n\\n\"Because I hope we are going to be great friends.\"\\n\\n\"What a funny reason.\"\\n\\nJohn stayed with them for an hour, and all the time watched, fascinated.\\n\"Have you got a crown?\" he asked. \"How did you learn to speak English?\\nWhat is that big ring made of? Did it cost much? Why are your nails that\\ncolour? Can you ride?\"\\n\\nShe answered all his questions, sometimes enigmatically with an eye on\\nTony. She took out a little heavily scented handkerchief and showed John\\nthe monogram. \"That is my only crown... now,\" she said. She told him\\nabout the horses she used to have--glossy black, with arched necks; foam\\nround their silver bits; plumes tossing on their foreheads; silver studs\\non the harness, crimson saddle cloths. \"On the Moulay\\'s birthday--\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the Moulay?\"\\n\\n\"A beautiful and a very bad man,\" she said gravely, \"and on his birthday\\nall his horsemen used to assemble round a great square, with all their\\nfinest clothes and trappings and jewels, with long swords in their\\nhands. The Moulay used to sit on a throne under a great crimson canopy.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s a canopy?\"\\n\\n\"Like a tent,\" she said more sharply, and then, resuming her soft voice,\\n\"and all the horsemen used to gallop across the plain, in a great cloud\\nof dust, waving their swords, straight towards the Moulay. And everyone\\nused to hold their breath, thinking the horsemen were bound to ride\\nright on top of the Moulay, but when they were a few feet away, as near\\nas I am to you, galloping at full speed, they used to rein their horses\\nback, up on to their hind legs and salute--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but they _shouldn\\'t_,\" said John. \"It\\'s _very_ bad horsemanship\\nindeed. Ben says so.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re the most wonderful horsemen in the world. Everyone knows that.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, they can\\'t be, if they do _that_. It\\'s one of the _worst_\\nthings. Were they natives?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Ben says natives aren\\'t humans at all really.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but he\\'s thinking of Negroes, I expect. These are pure Semitic\\ntype.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"The same as Jews.\"\\n\\n\"Ben says Jews are worse than natives.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, what a very severe boy you are. I was like that once. Life\\nteaches one to be tolerant.\"\\n\\n\"It hasn\\'t taught Ben,\" said John. \"When\\'s mummy coming? I thought she\\'d\\nbe here, otherwise I wouldn\\'t have stopped painting my picture.\"\\n\\nBut when nanny came to fetch him, John, without invitation, went over\\nand kissed Jenny good night. \"Good night, Johnny-boy,\" she said.\\n\\n\"What did you call me?\"\\n\\n\"Johnny-boy.\"\\n\\n\"You are funny with names.\"\\n\\nUpstairs, meditatively splashing his spoon in the bread and milk, he\\nsaid, \"Nanny, I do think that Princess is beautiful, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nNanny sniffed. \"It would be a dull world if we all thought alike,\" she\\nsaid.\\n\\n\"She\\'s more beautiful than Miss Tendril, even. I think she\\'s the most\\nbeautiful lady I\\'ve ever seen... D\\'you think she\\'d like to watch me\\nhave my bath?\"\\n\\nDownstairs, Jenny said, \"What a heavenly child... I love children. That\\nhas been my great tragedy. It was when he found I couldn\\'t have children\\nthat the Moulay first showed the Other Side of his Nature. It wasn\\'t my\\nfault... you see my womb is out of place... I don\\'t know why I\\'m\\ntelling you all this, but I feel you\\'ll understand. It\\'s such a _waste\\nof time_, isn\\'t it, when one knows one is going to like someone and one\\ngoes on _pretending_... I know at once if someone is going to be a real\\nfriend...\"\\n\\nPolly and Brenda arrived just before seven. Brenda went straight up to\\nthe nursery. \"Oh, mummy,\" said John, \"there\\'s such a beautiful lady\\ndownstairs. Do ask her to come and say good night. Nanny doesn\\'t think\\nshe\\'d want to.\"\\n\\n\"Did daddy seem to like her?\"\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t talk much... She doesn\\'t know anything about horses or\\nnatives but she _is_ beautiful. Please tell her to come up.\"\\n\\nBrenda went downstairs and found Jenny with Polly and Tony in the\\nsmoking-room. \"You\\'ve made a wild success with John Andrew. He won\\'t go\\nto sleep until he\\'s seen you again.\"\\n\\nThey went up together, and Jenny said, \"They\\'re both such dears.\"\\n\\n\"Did you and Tony get on? I was so sorry not to be here when you\\narrived.\"\\n\\n\"He was _so_ sympathetic and gentle... and so wistful.\"\\n\\nThey sat on John\\'s small bed in the night-nursery. He threw the clothes\\nback and crawled out, nestling against Jenny. \"Back to bed,\" she said,\\n\"or I shall spank you.\"\\n\\n\"Would you do it hard? I shouldn\\'t mind.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear,\" said Brenda, \"what a terrible effect you seem to have. He\\'s\\nnever like this as a rule.\"\\n\\nWhen they had gone nanny threw open another window.\\n\\n\"Poof!\" she said, \"making the whole place stink.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you like it? _I_ think it\\'s lovely.\"\\n\\nBrenda took Polly up to Lyonesse. It was a large suite, fitted up with\\nsatinwood for King Edward when, as Prince of Wales, he was once expected\\nat a shooting party; he never came.\\n\\n\"How\\'s it going?\" she asked anxiously.\\n\\n\"Too soon to tell. I\\'m sure it will be all right.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s got the wrong chap. John Andrew\\'s mad about her... quite\\nembarrassing.\"\\n\\n\"I should say Tony was a slow starter. It\\'s a pity she\\'s got his name\\nwrong. Ought we to tell her?\"\\n\\n\"No, let\\'s leave it.\"\\n\\nWhen they were dressing, Tony said, \"Brenda, who _is_ this joke-woman?\"\\n\\n\"Darling, don\\'t you like her?\"\\n\\nThe disappointment and distress in her tone were so clear that Tony was\\ntouched. \"I don\\'t know about not liking her exactly. She\\'s just a joke,\\nisn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Is she... oh dear... She\\'s had a terrible life, you know.\"\\n\\n\"So I gathered.\"\\n\\n\"Be nice to her, Tony, please.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll be nice to her. Is she a Jewess?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I never thought. Perhaps she is.\"\\n\\nSoon after dinner Polly said she was tired and asked Brenda to come with\\nher while she undressed, \"Leave the young couple to it,\" she whispered\\noutside the door.\\n\\n\"My dear, I don\\'t believe it\\'s going to be any good... the poor old\\nboy\\'s got _some_ taste you know, and a sense of humour.\"\\n\\n\"She didn\\'t show up too well at dinner, did she?\"\\n\\n\"She will _go on_ so... and, after all, Tony\\'s been used to me for\\nseven years. It\\'s rather a sudden change.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Tired?\"\\n\\n\"Mmm. Little bit.\"\\n\\n\"You gave me a pretty long bout of Abdul Akbar.\"\\n\\n\"I know. I\\'m sorry, darling, but Polly takes so long to get to bed...\\nWas it awful? I wish you liked her more.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s awful.\"\\n\\n\"One has to make allowances... she\\'s got the most terrible scars.\"\\n\\n\"So she told me.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen them.\"\\n\\n\"Besides, I hoped to see something of you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"Brenda, you aren\\'t angry still about my getting tight that night and\\nwaking you up?\"\\n\\n\"No, sweet, do I seem angry?\"\\n\\n\"...I don\\'t know. You do rather... Has it been an amusing week?\"\\n\\n\"Not amusing, very hard work. Bimetallism, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes... well, I suppose you want to go to sleep.\"\\n\\n\"Mm... so tired. Good night, darling.\"\\n\\n\"Good night.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Can I go and say good morning to the Princess, mummy?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t expect she\\'s awake yet.\"\\n\\n\"Please, mummy, may I go and see? I\\'ll just peep and, if she\\'s asleep,\\ngo away.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what room she\\'s in.\"\\n\\n\"Galahad, my lady,\" said Grimshawe, who was putting out her clothes.\\n\\n\"Oh dear, why was she put there?\"\\n\\n\"It was Mr Last\\'s orders, my lady.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she\\'s probably awake, then.\"\\n\\nJohn slipped out of the room and trotted down the passage to Galahad.\\n\"May I come in?\"\\n\\n\"Hullo, Johnny-boy. Come in.\"\\n\\nHe swung on the handles of the door, half in, half out of the room.\\n\"Have you had breakfast? Mummy said you wouldn\\'t be awake.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been awake a long time. You see I was once very badly hurt, and\\nnow I don\\'t always sleep well. Even the softest beds are too hard for me\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Ooh. What did you do? Was it a motor-car accident?\"\\n\\n\"Not an accident, Johnny-boy, not an accident... but come in. It\\'s cold\\nwith the door open. Look, there are some grapes here. Would you like to\\neat them?\"\\n\\nJohnny climbed on to the bed. \"What are you going to do to-day?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know yet. I haven\\'t been told.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll tell you. We\\'ll go to church in the morning because I have\\nto and then we\\'ll go and look at Thunderclap and I\\'ll show you the place\\nwe jump and then you can come with me while I have dinner because I have\\nit early and afterwards we can go down to Bruton Wood and we needn\\'t\\ntake nanny because it makes her so muddy and you can see where they dug\\nout a fox in the drain just outside the wood, he nearly got away, and\\nthen you can come and have tea in the nursery and I\\'ve got a little\\ngramophone Uncle Reggie gave me for Christmas and it plays \"When Father\\nPapered the Parlour\", do you know that song? Ben can sing it and I\\'ve\\ngot some books to show you and a picture I did of the battle of Marston\\nMoor.\"\\n\\n\"I think that sounds a lovely day. But don\\'t you think I ought to spend\\nsome time with daddy and mummy and Lady Cockpurse?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _them_... besides, it\\'s all my foot about Lady Cockpurse having a\\ntail. Please, you _will_ spend the day with me?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll see.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"She\\'s gone to church with him. That\\'s a good sign, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, not really, Polly. He likes going alone, or with me. It\\'s the\\ntime he gossips to the village.\"\\n\\n\"She won\\'t stop him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid you don\\'t understand the old boy altogether. He\\'s much odder\\nthan you\\'d think.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"I could see from your sermon that you knew the East, Rector.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, most of my life.\"\\n\\n\"It has an uncanny fascination, hasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come on,\" said John, pulling at her coat. \"We must go and see\\nThunderclap.\"\\n\\nSo Tony returned alone with the buttonholes.\\n\\nAfter luncheon Brenda said, \"Why don\\'t you show Jenny the house?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, _do_.\"\\n\\nWhen they reached the morning-room he said, \"Brenda\\'s having it done\\nup.\"\\n\\nThere were planks and ladders and heaps of plaster about.\\n\\n\"Oh, Teddy, what a shame. I do hate seeing things modernized.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t a room we used very much.\"\\n\\n\"No, but still...\" She stirred the mouldings of fleur-de-lis that\\nlittered the floor, fragments of tarnished gilding and dusty\\nstencil-work. \"You know, Brenda\\'s been a wonderful friend to me. I\\nwouldn\\'t say anything against her... but ever since I came here I\\'ve\\nbeen wondering whether she really understands this beautiful place and\\nall it means to you.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me more about your terrible life,\" said Tony, leading her back to\\nthe central hall.\\n\\n\"You _are_ shy of talking about yourself, aren\\'t you, Teddy? It\\'s a\\nmistake, you know, to keep things bottled up. I\\'ve been very unhappy\\ntoo.\"\\n\\nTony looked about him desperately in search of help; and help came. \"Oh,\\nthere you are,\" said a firm, child\\'s voice. \"Come on. We\\'re going down\\nto the woods now. We must hurry, otherwise it will be dark.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Johnny-boy, must I really? I was just talking to daddy.\"\\n\\n\"_Come on._ It\\'s all arranged. And afterwards you\\'re to be allowed to\\nhave tea with me upstairs.\"\\n\\nTony crept into the library, habitable to-day, since the workmen were at\\nrest. Brenda found him there two hours later. \"_Tony_, here all alone?\\nWe thought you were with Jenny. What have you done with her?\"\\n\\n\"John took her off... just in time before I said something rude.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear... well there\\'s only me and Polly in the smoking-room. Come\\nand have some tea. You look all funny--have you been asleep?\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"We must write it down a failure, definitely.\"\\n\\n\"What _does_ the old boy expect? It isn\\'t as though he was everybody\\'s\\nmoney.\"\\n\\n\"I daresay it would have been all right, if she hadn\\'t got his name\\nwrong.\"\\n\\n\"Anyway, this lets _you_ out. You\\'ve done far more than most wives would\\nto cheer the old boy up.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s certainly true,\" said Brenda.\\n\\n\\n[IV]\\n\\nAnother five days; then Brenda came to Hetton again. \"I shan\\'t be here\\nnext week-end,\" she said, \"I\\'m going to stay with Veronica.\"\\n\\n\"Am I asked?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you _were_, of course, but I refused for you. You know you always\\nhate staying away.\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t mind coming.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, darling, I wish I\\'d known. Veronica would have loved it so... but\\nI\\'m afraid it will be too late now. She\\'s only got a tiny house... to\\ntell you the truth I didn\\'t think you liked her much.\"\\n\\n\"I hated her like hell.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then...?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it doesn\\'t matter. I suppose you must go back on Monday? The hounds\\nare meeting on Wednesday, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Are we giving them a lawner?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, darling, you know we do every year.\"\\n\\n\"So we do.\"\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t stay down till then?\"\\n\\n\"Not possibly, darling. You see if I miss one lecture I get right behind\\nand can\\'t follow the next. Besides, I am not mad keen to see the\\nhounds.\"\\n\\n\"Ben was asking if we\\'d let John go out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s far too young.\"\\n\\n\"Not to hunt. But I thought he might bring his pony to the meet and ride\\nwith them to the first covert. He\\'d love it so.\"\\n\\n\"Is it quite safe?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, surely?\"\\n\\n\"Bless his heart, I wish I could be here to see him.\"\\n\\n\"Do change your mind.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, that\\'s quite out of the question. Don\\'t make a thing about it,\\nTony.\"\\n\\nThat was when she first arrived; later everything got better. Jock was\\nthere that week-end, also Allan and Marjorie and another married couple\\nwhom Tony had known all his life. Brenda had arranged the party for him\\nand he enjoyed it. He and Allan went out with rook rifles and shot\\nrabbits in the twilight; after dinner the four men played billiard fives\\nwhile one wife watched. \"The old boy\\'s happy as a lark,\" said Brenda to\\nMarjorie. \"He\\'s settling down wonderfully to the new r?gime.\"\\n\\nThey came in breathless and rather flushed for whisky and soda.\\n\\n\"Tony nearly had one through the window,\" said Jock.\\n\\nThat night Tony slept in Guinevere.\\n\\n\"Everything _is_ all right, isn\\'t it?\" he said once.\\n\\n\"Yes, of course, darling.\"\\n\\n\"I get depressed down here all alone and imagine things.\"\\n\\n\"You aren\\'t to _brood_, Tony. You know that\\'s one of the things that\\naren\\'t allowed.\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t brood any more,\" said Tony.\\n\\nNext day Brenda came to church with him. She had decided to devote the\\nweek-end wholly to him; it would be the last for some time.\\n\\n\"And how are the abstruse sciences, Lady Brenda?\"\\n\\n\"Absorbing.\"\\n\\n\"We shall all be coming to you for advice about our overdrafts.\"\\n\\n\"Ha, ha.\"\\n\\n\"And how\\'s Thunderclap?\" asked Miss Tendril.\\n\\n\"I\\'m taking her out hunting on Wednesday,\" said John. He had forgotten\\nPrincess Abdul Akbar in the excitement of the coming meet. \"Please God\\nmake there be a good scent. Please God make me see the kill. Please God\\ndon\\'t let me do anything wrong. God bless Ben and Thunderclap. Please\\nGod make me jump an enormous great oxer,\" he had kept repeating\\nthroughout the service.\\n\\nBrenda did the round with Tony of cottages and hothouses; she helped him\\nchoose his buttonhole.\\n\\nTony was in high spirits at luncheon. Brenda had begun to forget how\\namusing he could be. Afterwards he changed into other clothes and went\\nwith Jock to play golf. They stayed some time at the clubhouse. Tony\\nsaid, \"We\\'ve got the hounds meeting at Hetton on Wednesday. Couldn\\'t you\\nstay down till then?\"\\n\\n\"Must be back. There\\'s going to be a debate on the Pig Scheme.\"\\n\\n\"I wish you\\'d stay. Look here, why don\\'t you ask that girl down?\\nEveryone goes to-morrow. You could ring her up, couldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I _could_.\"\\n\\n\"Would she hate it? She could have Lyonesse--Polly slept there two\\nweek-ends running, so it can\\'t be too uncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'d probably love it. I\\'ll ring up and ask her.\"\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you hunt too? There\\'s a chap called Brinkwell who\\'s got some\\nquite decent hirelings, I believe.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I might.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Jock\\'s staying on. He\\'s having the Shameless Blonde down. You don\\'t\\nmind?\"\\n\\n\"Me? Of course not.\"\\n\\n\"This _has_ been a jolly week-end.\"\\n\\n\"I thought you were enjoying it.\"\\n\\n\"Just like old times--before the economics began.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nMarjorie said to Jock, \"D\\'you think Tony knows about Mr Beaver?\"\\n\\n\"Not a thing.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t mentioned it to Allan. D\\'you suppose he knows?\"\\n\\n\"I doubt it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Jock, how d\\'you think it\\'ll end?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'ll get bored with Beaver soon enough.\"\\n\\n\"The trouble is that he doesn\\'t care for her in the least. If he did, it\\nwould soon be over... What an ass she is being.\"\\n\\n\"I should say she was managing it unusually well, if you ask me.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThe other married couple said to each other, \"D\\'you think Marjorie and\\nAllan know about Brenda?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure they don\\'t.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda said to Allan, \"Tony\\'s as happy as a sandboy, isn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Full of beans.\"\\n\\n\"I was getting worried about him... You don\\'t think he\\'s got any idea\\nabout my goings on?\"\\n\\n\"Lord no. It\\'s the last thing that would come into his head.\"\\n\\nBrenda said, \"I don\\'t want him to be unhappy, you know... Marjorie\\'s\\nbeen frightfully governessy about the whole thing.\"\\n\\n\"Has she? I haven\\'t discussed it with her.\"\\n\\n\"How did _you_ hear?\"\\n\\n\"My dear girl, until this minute I didn\\'t know you had any goings on.\\nAnd I\\'m not asking any questions about them now.\"\\n\\n\"Oh... I thought everyone knew.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s always the trouble with people when they start walking out. They\\neither think no one knows, or everybody. The truth is that a few people\\nlike Polly and Sybil make a point of finding out about everyone\\'s\\nprivate life; the rest of us just aren\\'t interested.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nLater he said to Marjorie, \"Brenda tried to be confidential about Beaver\\nthis evening.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know you knew.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I knew all right. But I wasn\\'t going to let her feel important by\\ntalking about it.\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t disapprove more of the whole thing. Do you know Beaver?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen him about. Anyway, it\\'s her business and Tony\\'s, not ours.\"\\n\\n\\n[V]\\n\\nJock\\'s blonde was called Mrs Rattery. Tony had conceived an idea of her\\nfrom what he overheard of Polly\\'s gossip and from various fragments of\\ninformation let fall by Jock. She was a little over thirty. Somewhere in\\nthe Cottesmore country there lived a long-legged, slightly discredited\\nMajor Rattery, to whom she had once been married. She was an American by\\norigin, now totally denationalized, rich, without property or\\npossessions, except those that would pack in five vast trunks. Jock had\\nhad his eye on her last summer at Biarritz and had fallen in with her\\nagain in London where she played big bridge, very ably, for six or seven\\nhours a day and changed her hotel, on an average, once every three\\nweeks. Periodically she was liable to bouts of morphine; then she gave\\nup her bridge and remained for several days at a time alone in her hotel\\nsuite, refreshed at intervals with glasses of cold milk.\\n\\nShe arrived by air on Monday afternoon. It was the first time that a\\nguest had come in this fashion and the household was appreciably\\nexcited. Under Jock\\'s direction the boiler man and one of the gardeners\\npegged out a dust sheet in the park to mark a landing for her and lit a\\nbonfire of damp leaves to show the direction of the wind. The five\\ntrunks arrived in the ordinary way by train, with an elderly,\\nirreproachable maid. She brought her own sheets with her in one of the\\ntrunks; they were neither silk nor coloured, without lace or ornament of\\nany kind, except small, plain monograms.\\n\\nTony, Jock and John went out to watch her land. She climbed out of the\\ncockpit, stretched, unbuttoned the flaps of her leather helmet, and came\\nto meet them. \"Forty-two minutes,\" she said, \"not at all bad with the\\nwind against me.\"\\n\\nShe was tall and erect, almost austere in helmet and overalls; not at\\nall as Tony had imagined her. Vaguely, at the back of his mind he had\\nsecreted the slightly absurd expectation of a chorus girl, in silk\\nshorts and brassi?re, popping out of an immense beribboned Easter egg\\nwith a cry of \"Whoopee, boys.\" Mrs Rattery\\'s greetings were deft and\\nimpersonal.\\n\\n\"Are you going to hunt on Wednesday?\" asked John. \"They\\'re meeting here,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\n\"I might go out for half the day, if I can find a horse. It\\'ll be the\\nfirst time this year.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my first time too.\"\\n\\n\"We shall both be terribly stiff.\" She spoke to him exactly as though he\\nwere a man of her own age. \"You\\'ll have to show me the country.\"\\n\\n\"I expect they\\'ll draw Bruton Wood first. There\\'s a big fox there, daddy\\nand I saw him.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nWhen they were alone together, Jock said, \"It\\'s delightful your coming\\ndown. What d\\'you think of Tony?\"\\n\\n\"Is he married to that rather lovely woman we saw at the Caf? de Paris?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"The one you said was in love with that young man?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Funny of her... What\\'s this one\\'s name again?\"\\n\\n\"Tony Last. It\\'s a pretty ghastly house, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Is it? I never notice houses much.\"\\n\\nShe was an easy guest to entertain. After dinner on Monday she produced\\nfour packs of cards and laid out for herself on the smoking-room table a\\nvery elaborate patience, which kept her engrossed all the evening.\\n\"Don\\'t wait up for me,\" she said. \"I shall stay here until it comes out.\\nIt often takes several hours.\"\\n\\nThey showed her where to put the lights out and left her to it.\\n\\nNext day Jock said, \"Have you got any pigs at the farm?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Would you mind if I went to see them?\"\\n\\n\"Not in the least--but why?\"\\n\\n\"And is there a man who looks after them, who will be able to explain\\nabout them?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I think I\\'ll spend the morning with him. I\\'ve got to make a\\nspeech about pigs, fairly soon.\"\\n\\nThey did not see Mrs Rattery until luncheon. Tony assumed she was asleep\\nuntil she appeared in overalls from the morning-room. \"I was down\\nearly,\" she explained, \"and found the men at work stripping the ceiling.\\nI couldn\\'t resist joining in. I hope you don\\'t mind.\"\\n\\nIn the afternoon they went to a neighbouring livery stables to look for\\nhirelings. After tea Tony wrote to Brenda; he had taken to writing\\nletters in the past few weeks.\\n\\n    How enjoyable the week-end was [he wrote]. Thank you a thousand\\n    times for all your sweetness. I wish you were coming down next\\n    week-end, or that you had been able to stay on a little, but I\\n    quite understand.\\n\\n    The Shameless Blonde is not the least what we expected--very\\n    serene and distant. Not at all like Jock\\'s usual taste. I am\\n    sure she hasn\\'t any idea where she is or what my name is.\\n\\n    The work in the morning-room is going on well. The foreman told\\n    me to-day he thought he would begin on the chromium plating by\\n    the end of the week. You know what I think about that.\\n\\n    John can talk of nothing except his hunting to-morrow. I hope he\\n    doesn\\'t break his neck. Jock and his S.B. are going out too.\\n\\nHetton lay near the boundary of three packs; the Pigstanton, who hunted\\nit, had, in the division of territory, come off with the worst country\\nand they cherished a permanent resentment about some woods near Bayton.\\nThey were a somewhat ill-tempered lot, contemptuous of each other\\'s\\nperformance, hostile to strangers, torn by internal rancour, united only\\nin their dislike of the Master. In the case of Colonel Inch this\\nunpopularity, traditional to the hunt, was quite undeserved; he was a\\ntimid, inconspicuous man who provided the neighbourhood with sport of a\\nkind at great personal expense. He himself was seldom in sight of hounds\\nand could often be found in another part of the country morosely\\nnibbling ginger-nut biscuits in a lane or towards the end of the day\\ncantering heavily across country, quite lost, a lonely scarlet figure\\nagainst the ploughed land, staring about him in the deepening twilight\\nand shouting at yokels for information. The only pleasure he gained from\\nhis position, but that a substantial one, was in referring to it\\ncasually at Board Meetings of the various companies he directed.\\n\\nThe Pigstanton met twice a week. There was seldom a large field on\\nWednesday, but the Hetton meet was popular; it lay in their best country\\nand the prospect of stirrup-cups had drawn many leathery old ladies from\\nthe neighbouring packs. There were also followers on foot and in every\\nkind of vehicle, some hanging back diffidently, others, more or less\\nknown to Tony, crowding round the refreshment table. Mr Tendril had a\\nniece staying with him, who appeared on a motor bicycle.\\n\\nJohn stood beside Thunderclap, solemn with excitement. Ben had secured a\\npowerful, square-headed mare from a neighbouring farmer; he hoped to\\nhave a hunt after John had been taken home; at John\\'s earnest entreaty\\nnanny was confined indoors, among the housemaids whose heads obtruded at\\nthe upper windows; it was not her day. She had been out of temper while\\ndressing him. \"If I\\'m in at the death I expect Colonel Inch will blood\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t see any death,\" said nanny.\\n\\nNow she stood with her eyes at an arrow slit gazing rather resentfully\\nat the animated scene below. \"It\\'s all a lot of nonsense of Ben\\nHacket\\'s,\" she thought. She deplored it all, hounds, Master, field,\\nhuntsman and whippers-in, Mr Tendril\\'s niece in her mackintosh, Jock in\\na rat-catcher, Mrs Rattery in tall hat and cutaway coat, oblivious of\\nthe suspicious glances of the subscribers, Tony smiling and chatting to\\nhis guests, the crazy old man with the terriers, the Press photographer,\\npretty Miss Ripon in difficulties with a young horse, titupping sideways\\nover the lawn, the grooms and second horses, the humble, unknown\\nfollowers in the background--it was all a lot of nonsense of Ben\\nHacket\\'s. \"It was after eleven before the child got to sleep last\\nnight,\" she reflected, \"he was that over-excited.\"\\n\\nPresently they moved off towards Bruton Wood. The way lay down the south\\ndrive through Compton Last, along the main road for half a mile, and\\nthen through fields. \"He can ride with them as far as the covert,\" Tony\\nhad said.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, and there\\'d be no harm in his stayin\\' a bit to see hounds\\nworking, would there?\"\\n\\n\"No, I suppose not.\"\\n\\n\"And if he breaks away towards home, there\\'d be no harm in our following\\na bit, if we keeps to the lanes and gates, would there, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, but he\\'s not to stay out more than an hour.\"\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t have me take him home with hounds running, would you,\\nsir?\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s got to be in before one.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see to that, sir. Don\\'t you worry, my beauty,\" he said to John,\\n\"you\\'ll get a hunt right enough.\"\\n\\nThey waited until the end of the line of horses and then trotted soberly\\nbehind them. Close at their heels followed the motor-cars, at low gear,\\nin a fog of exhaust. John was breathless and slightly dizzy. Thunderclap\\nwas tossing her head and worrying at her snaffle. Twice while the field\\nwas moving off she had tried to get away and had taken John round in a\\nlittle circle, so that Ben had said, \"Hold on to her, son\", and had come\\nup close beside him so as to be able to catch the reins if she looked\\nlike bolting. Once, boring forwards with her head, she took John by\\nsurprise and pulled him forwards out of his balance; he caught hold of\\nthe front of the saddle to steady himself and looked guiltily at Ben.\\n\"I\\'m afraid I\\'m riding very badly to-day. D\\'you think anyone has\\nnoticed?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, son. You can\\'t keep riding-school manners when you\\'re\\nhunting.\"\\n\\nJock and Mrs Rattery trotted side by side. \"I rather like this absurd\\nhorse,\" she said. She rode astride and it was evident from the moment\\nshe mounted that she rode extremely well.\\n\\nThe members of the Pigstanton noted this with ill-concealed resentment,\\nfor it disturbed their fixed opinion, according to which, while all\\nfellow members of the hunt were clowns and poltroons, strangers were,\\nwithout exception, mannerless lunatics, and a serious menace to anyone\\nwithin a quarter of a mile of them.\\n\\nHalf-way through the village Miss Ripon had difficulties in getting past\\na stationary baker\\'s van. Her horse plunged and reared, trembling all\\nover, turning about and slipping frantically over the tarmac. They rode\\nround her, giving his heels the widest berth, scowling ominously and\\ngrumbling about her. They all knew that horse. Miss Ripon\\'s father had\\nbeen trying to sell him all the season, and had lately come down to\\neighty pounds. He was a good jumper on occasions but a beast of a horse\\nto ride. Did Miss Ripon\\'s father really imagine he was improving his\\nchances of a sale by letting Miss Ripon make an exhibition of herself?\\nIt was like that skinflint, Miss Ripon\\'s father, to risk Miss Ripon\\'s\\nneck for eighty pounds. And, anyway, Miss Ripon had no business out on\\n_any_ horse...\\n\\nPresently she shot past them at a gallop; she was flushed in the face\\nand her bun was askew; she leant back, pulling with all her weight.\\n\"That girl will come to no good,\" said Jock.\\n\\nThey encountered her later at the covert. Her horse was sweating and\\nlathered at the bridle but temporarily at rest, cropping the tufts of\\nsedge that lay round the woods. Miss Ripon was much out of breath, and\\nher hands shook as she fiddled with veil, bun and bowler. John rode up\\nto Jock\\'s side.\\n\\n\"What\\'s happening, Mr Grant-Menzies?\"\\n\\n\"Hounds are drawing the covert.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"Are you enjoying yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. Thunderclap\\'s terribly fresh. I\\'ve never known her like this.\"\\n\\nThere was a long wait as the horn sounded in the heart of the wood.\\nEveryone stood in the corner of the big field, near a gate. Everyone,\\nthat is to say, except Miss Ripon, who some minutes ago had disappeared\\nsuddenly, indeed in the middle of a sentence, at full gallop towards\\nHetton Hills. After half an hour Jock said, \"They\\'re calling hounds\\noff.\"\\n\\n\"Does that mean it\\'s a blank?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid so.\"\\n\\n\"I hate this happening in _our_ woods,\" said Ben. \"Looks bad.\"\\n\\nIndeed the Pigstanton were already beginning to forget their hospitality\\nand to ask each other what did one expect when Last did not hunt\\nhimself, and to circulate dark reports of how one of the keepers had\\nbeen observed last week burying Something late in the evening.\\n\\nThey moved off again, away from Hetton. Ben began to feel his\\nresponsibility. \"D\\'you think I ought to take the young gentleman home,\\nsir?\"\\n\\n\"What did Mr Last say?\"\\n\\n\"He said he could go as far as the covert. He didn\\'t say which, sir.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it sounds as if he ought to go.\"\\n\\n\"_Oh, Mr Menzies!_\"\\n\\n\"Yes, come along, Master John. You\\'ve had enough for to-day.\"\\n\\n\"But I haven\\'t had _any_.\"\\n\\n\"If you come back in good time to-day your dad will be all the more\\nwilling to let you come out another day.\"\\n\\n\"But there mayn\\'t _be_ another day. The world may come to an end.\\n_Please_, Ben. _Please_, Mr Menzies.\"\\n\\n\"It is a shame they shouldn\\'t have found,\" said Ben. \"He\\'s been looking\\nforward to it.\"\\n\\n\"Still, I think Mr Last would want him to go back,\" said Jock.\\n\\nSo John\\'s fate was decided; hounds went in one direction, he and Ben in\\nanother. John was very near tears as they reached the main road.\\n\\n\"Look,\" said Ben, to encourage him. \"Here comes Miss Ripon on that nappy\\nbay. Seems as if she\\'s going in, too. Had a fall by the looks of her.\"\\n\\nMiss Ripon\\'s hat and back were covered with mud and moss. She had had a\\nbad twenty minutes after her disappearance. \"I\\'m taking him away,\" she\\nsaid. \"I can\\'t do anything with him this morning.\" She jogged along\\nbeside them towards the village. \"I thought perhaps Mr Last would let me\\ncome up to the house and telephone for the car. I don\\'t feel like\\nhacking him home in his present state. I can\\'t think what\\'s come over\\nhim,\" she added loyally. \"He was out on Saturday. I\\'ve never known him\\nlike this before.\"\\n\\n\"He wants a man up,\" said Ben.\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s no better with the groom, and daddy won\\'t go near him,\" said\\nMiss Ripon, stung to indiscretion. \"At least... I mean... I don\\'t\\nthink that they\\'d be any better with him in this state.\"\\n\\nHe was quiet enough at that moment, keeping pace with the other horses.\\nThey rode abreast, she on the outside with John\\'s pony between her and\\nBen.\\n\\nThen this happened: they reached a turn in the road and came face to\\nface with one of the single-decker country buses that covered that\\nneighbourhood. It was not going fast and, seeing the horses, the driver\\nslowed down still further and drew into the side. Mr Tendril\\'s niece,\\nwho had also despaired of the day\\'s sport, was following behind them at\\na short distance on her motor bicycle; she too slowed down, and,\\nobserving that Miss Ripon\\'s horse was likely to be difficult, stopped.\\n\\nBen said, \"Let me go first, Miss. He\\'ll follow. Don\\'t hold too hard on\\nhis mouth and just give him a tap.\"\\n\\nMiss Ripon did as she was told; everyone in fact behaved with complete\\ngood sense.\\n\\nThey drew abreast of the omnibus. Miss Ripon\\'s horse did not like it,\\nbut it seemed as though he would get by. The passengers watched with\\namusement. At that moment the motor bicycle, running gently in neutral\\ngear, fired back into the cylinder with a sharp detonation.\\n\\nFor a second Miss Ripon\\'s horse stood rigid with alarm; then, menaced in\\nfront and behind, he did what was natural to him and shied sideways,\\ncannoning violently into the pony at his side. John was knocked from the\\nsaddle and fell on the road while Miss Ripon\\'s bay, rearing and\\nskidding, continued to plunge away from the bus.\\n\\n\"Take a hold of him, Miss. Use your whip,\" shouted Ben.\\n\\n\"The boy\\'s down.\"\\n\\nShe hit him and the horse collected himself and bolted up the road into\\nthe village, but before he went one of his heels struck out and sent\\nJohn into the ditch, where he lay bent double, perfectly still.\\n\\nEveryone agreed that it was nobody\\'s fault.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nIt was nearly an hour before the news reached Jock and Mrs Rattery where\\nthey were waiting beside another blank covert. Colonel Inch stopped\\nhunting for the day and sent the hounds back to the kennels. The voices\\nwere hushed which, five minutes before, had been proclaiming that they\\nknew it for a fact, Last had given orders to shoot every fox on the\\nplace. Later, after their baths, they made up for it in criticism of\\nMiss Ripon\\'s father, but at the moment everyone was shocked and silent.\\nSomeone lent Jock and Mrs Rattery a car to get home in, and a groom to\\nsee to the hirelings.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the most appalling thing,\" said Jock in the borrowed car. \"What on\\nearth are we going to say to Tony?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m the last person to have about on an occasion like this,\" said Mrs\\nRattery.\\n\\nThey passed the scene of the accident; there were still people hanging\\nabout, talking.\\n\\nThere were people hanging about, talking in the hall at the house. The\\ndoctor was buttoning up his coat, just going.\\n\\n\"Killed instantly,\" he said. \"Took it full on the base of the skull.\\nVery sad, awfully fond of the kid. No one to blame, though.\"\\n\\nNanny was there in tears, also Mr Tendril and his niece; a policeman and\\nBen and two men who had helped bring up the body were in the servants\\'\\nhall. \"It wasn\\'t the kid\\'s fault,\" said Ben.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t anyone\\'s fault,\" they said.\\n\\n\"He\\'d had a lousy day, too, poor little bastard,\" said Ben.\\n\\n\"If it was anyone\\'s fault it was Mr Grant-Menzies making him go in.\"\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t anyone\\'s fault,\" they said.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTony was alone in the library. The first thing he said, when Jock came\\nin, was, \"We\\'ve got to tell Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you know where to get her?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s probably at that school... But we can\\'t tell her over the\\ntelephone... Anyway, Ambrose has tried there and the flat but he can\\'t\\nget through... What on earth are we going to say to her?\"\\n\\nJock was silent. He stood in the fireplace with his hands in the pockets\\nof his breeches, with his back to Tony. Presently Tony said, \"You\\nweren\\'t anywhere near, were you?\"\\n\\n\"No, we\\'d gone on to another covert.\"\\n\\n\"That niece of Mr Tendril\\'s told me first... then we met them coming\\nup, and Ben told me all that happened... It\\'s awful for the girl.\"\\n\\n\"Miss Ripon?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she\\'s just left... she had a nasty fall too, just after. Her\\nhorse slipped up in the village... she was in a terrible state, poor\\nchild, what with that and... John. She didn\\'t know she\\'d hurt him until\\nquite a time afterwards... she was in the chemist\\'s shop having a\\nbandage put on her head, when they told her. She cut it falling. She was\\nin a terrible state. I sent her back in the car... it wasn\\'t her\\nfault.\"\\n\\n\"No, it wasn\\'t anybody\\'s fault. It just happened.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" said Tony. \"It just happened... how are we going to tell\\nBrenda?\"\\n\\n\"One of us will have to go up.\"\\n\\n\"Yes... I think I shall have to stay here. I don\\'t know why really,\\nbut there will be things to see to. It\\'s an awful thing to ask anyone\\nto do...\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go,\" said Jock.\\n\\n\"There\\'ll be things to see to there... there\\'s got to be an inquest the\\ndoctor says. It\\'s purely formal, of course, but it will be ghastly for\\nthat Ripon girl. She\\'ll have to give evidence... she was in a terrible\\nstate. I hope I was all right to her. They\\'d just brought John in and I\\nwas rather muddled. She looked awful. I believe her father\\'s bloody to\\nher... I wish Brenda had been here. She\\'s so good with everyone. I get\\nin a muddle.\"\\n\\nThe two men stood in silence. Tony said, \"Can you really face going up\\nand seeing Brenda?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll go,\" said Jock.\\n\\nPresently Mrs Rattery came in. \"Colonel Inch has been here,\" she said.\\n\"I talked to him. He wanted to give you his sympathy.\"\\n\\n\"Is he still here?\"\\n\\n\"No, I told him you\\'d probably prefer to be left alone. He thought you\\'d\\nbe glad to hear he stopped the hunt.\"\\n\\n\"Nice of him to come... Were you having a good day?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry. We saw a fox in Bruton Wood last week. John and I... Jock\\'s\\ngoing up to London to fetch Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take him in the aeroplane. It\\'ll be quicker.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that will be quicker.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go and change now. I won\\'t be ten minutes.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll change, too,\" said Jock.\\n\\nWhen he was alone Tony rang the bell. A young footman answered; he was\\nquite young and had not been long at Hetton.\\n\\n\"Will you tell Mr Ambrose that Mrs Rattery is leaving to-day. She is\\nflying up with Mr Grant-Menzies. Her ladyship will probably be coming by\\nthe evening train.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\n\\n\"They had better have some luncheon before they go. I will have it with\\nthem... And will you put a call through to Colonel Inch and thank him\\nfor coming? Say I will write. And to Mr Ripon\\'s to enquire how Miss\\nRipon is? And to the vicarage and ask Mr Tendril if I can see him this\\nevening? He\\'s not here still?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir, he left a few minutes ago.\"\\n\\n\"Tell him I shall have to discuss arrangements with him.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\n\\nMr Last was very matter of fact about everything, the footman reported\\nlater.\\n\\nIt was perfectly quiet in the library, for the workmen in the\\nmorning-room had laid aside their tools for the day.\\n\\nMrs Rattery was ready first.\\n\\n\"They\\'re just getting luncheon.\"\\n\\n\"We shan\\'t want any,\" she said. \"You forget we were going hunting.\"\\n\\n\"Better have something,\" said Tony, and then, \"It\\'s awful for Jock,\\nhaving to tell Brenda. I wonder how long it will be before she arrives.\"\\n\\nThere was something in Tony\\'s voice as he said this which made Mrs\\nRattery ask, \"What are you going to do while you\\'re waiting?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. I suppose there will be things to see to.\"\\n\\n\"Look here,\" said Mrs Rattery, \"Jock had better go up by car. I\\'ll stay\\nhere until Lady Brenda comes.\"\\n\\n\"It would be awful for you.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll stay.\"\\n\\nTony said, \"I suppose it\\'s ridiculous of me, but I wish you would... I\\nmean, won\\'t it be awful for you? I am all in a muddle. It\\'s so hard to\\nbelieve yet that it really happened.\"\\n\\n\"It happened all right.\"\\n\\nThe footman came to say that Mr Tendril would call after tea that day;\\nthat Miss Ripon had gone straight to bed and was asleep.\\n\\n\"Mr Grant-Menzies is going up in his car. He may be back to-night,\" said\\nTony. \"Mrs Rattery is waiting until her ladyship arrives.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, sir. And Colonel Inch wanted to know whether you would care\\nto have the huntsmen blow \"Gone to ground\" at the funeral.\"\\n\\n\"Say that I\\'ll write to him,\" and, when the footman had left the room,\\nTony said, \"An atrocious suggestion.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know. He\\'s very anxious to be helpful.\"\\n\\n\"They don\\'t like him much as Master.\"\\n\\nJock left soon after half-past two. Tony and Mrs Rattery had coffee in\\nthe library.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid this is a very difficult situation,\" said Tony. \"After all\\nwe scarcely know each other.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t have to think about me.\"\\n\\n\"But it must be awful for you.\"\\n\\n\"And you must stop thinking that.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try... the absurd thing is that I\\'m not thinking it, just saying\\nit... I keep thinking of other things all the time.\"\\n\\n\"I know. You don\\'t have to say anything.\"\\n\\nPresently Tony said, \"It\\'s going to be so much worse for Brenda. You see\\nshe\\'d got nothing else, much, except John. I\\'ve got her, and I love the\\nhouse... but with Brenda John always came first... naturally... And\\nthen you know she\\'s seen so little of John lately. She\\'s been in London\\nsuch a lot. I\\'m afraid that\\'s going to hurt her.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t ever tell what\\'s going to hurt people.\"\\n\\n\"But, you see, I know Brenda so well.\"\\n\\n\\n[VI]\\n\\nThe library windows were open and the clock, striking the hour, high\\nover head among its crockets and finials, was clearly audible in the\\nquiet room. It was some time since they had spoken. Mrs Rattery sat with\\nher back to Tony; she had spread out her intricate four-pack patience on\\na card table; he was in front of the fire, in the chair he had taken\\nafter lunch.\\n\\n\"Only four o\\'clock?\" he said.\\n\\n\"I thought you were asleep.\"\\n\\n\"No, just thinking... Jock will be more than half-way there by now,\\nabout Aylesbury or Tring.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a slow way to travel.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s less than four hours ago that it happened... it\\'s odd to think\\nthat this is the same day; that it\\'s only five hours ago they were all\\nhere at the meet having drinks.\" There was a pause in which Mrs Rattery\\nswept up the cards and began to deal them again. \"It was twenty-eight\\nminutes past twelve when I heard. I looked at my watch... It was ten to\\none when they brought John in... just over three hours ago... It\\'s\\nalmost incredible, isn\\'t it, everything becoming absolutely different,\\nsuddenly like that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s always that way,\" said Mrs Rattery.\\n\\n\"Brenda will hear in an hour now... if Jock finds her in. Of course she\\nmay very likely be out. He won\\'t know where to find her, because there\\'s\\nno one else in the flat. She leaves it locked up, empty, when she goes\\nout... and she\\'s out half the day. I know because I sometimes ring up\\nand can\\'t get an answer. He may not find her for hours... It may be as\\nlong again as the time since it happened. That would only make it eight\\no\\'clock. It\\'s quite likely she won\\'t come in until eight... Think of\\nit, all the time between now and when it happened, before Brenda hears.\\nIt\\'s scarcely credible, is it? And then she\\'s got to get down here.\\nThere\\'s a train that leaves at nine something. She might get that. I\\nwonder if I ought to have gone up too... I didn\\'t like to leave John.\"\\n\\n(Mrs Rattery sat intent over her game, moving little groups of cards\\nadroitly backwards and forwards about the table like shuttles across a\\nloom; under her fingers order grew out of chaos; she established\\nsequence and precedence; the symbols before her became coherent,\\ninterrelated.)\\n\\n\"...Of course she may be at home when he arrives. In that case she can\\nget the evening train she used always to come by, when she went to\\nLondon for the day, before she got the flat... I\\'m trying to see it\\nall, as it\\'s going to happen, Jock coming and her surprise at seeing\\nhim, and then his telling her... It\\'s awful for Jock... She may know\\nat half-past five or a bit earlier.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity you don\\'t play patience,\" said Mrs Rattery.\\n\\n\"In a way I shall feel happier when she knows... it feels all wrong as\\nit is at present, having it as a secret that Brenda doesn\\'t know... I\\'m\\nnot sure how she fits in her day. I suppose her last lecture is over at\\nabout five... I wonder if she goes home first to change if she\\'s going\\nout to tea or cocktails. She can\\'t sit about much in the flat, it\\'s so\\nsmall.\"\\n\\nMrs Rattery brooded over her chequer of cards and then drew them towards\\nher into a heap, haphazard once more and without meaning; it had nearly\\ncome to a solution that time, but for a six of diamonds out of place,\\nand a stubbornly congested patch at one corner, where nothing could be\\nmade to move. \"It\\'s a heart-breaking game,\" she said.\\n\\nThe clock struck again.\\n\\n\"Is that only a quarter-past?... You know, I think I should have gone\\noff my head if I were alone. It\\'s nice of you to stay with me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you play bezique?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid not.\"\\n\\n\"Or piquet?\"\\n\\n\"No. I\\'ve never been able to learn any card game except animal snap.\"\\n\\n\"Pity.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s Marjorie and several people I ought to wire to, but I\\'d better\\nwait until I know that Jock has seen Brenda. Suppose she was with\\nMarjorie when the telegram arrived.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to try and stop thinking about things. Can you throw craps?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy; I\\'ll show you. There\\'ll be some dice in the backgammon\\nboard.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m all right, really. I\\'d sooner not play.\"\\n\\n\"You get the dice and sit up here at the table. We\\'ve got six hours to\\nget through.\"\\n\\nShe showed him how to throw craps. He said, \"I\\'ve seen it on the\\ncinema--pullman porters and taxi men.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you have, it\\'s easy... there you see you\\'ve won, you take\\nall.\"\\n\\nPresently Tony said, \"I\\'ve just thought of something.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you ever take a rest from thinking?\"\\n\\n\"Suppose the evening papers have got hold of it already. Brenda may\\nsee it on a placard, or just pick up a paper casually and there it\\nwill be... perhaps with a photograph.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I thought of that just now, when you were talking about\\ntelegraphing.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s quite likely, isn\\'t it? They get hold of everything so\\nquickly. What can we do about it?\"\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t anything we can do. We\\'ve just got to wait... Come on,\\nboy, throw up.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to play any more. I\\'m worried.\"\\n\\n\"I know you\\'re worried. You don\\'t have to tell me... you aren\\'t going\\nto give up playing just when the luck\\'s running your way?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry... it isn\\'t any good.\"\\n\\nHe walked about the room, first to the window, then to the fireplace. He\\nbegan to fill his pipe. \"At least we can find out whether the evening\\npapers have got it in. We can ring up and ask the hall porter at my\\nclub.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not going to prevent your wife reading it. We\\'ve just got to\\nwait. What was the game you said you knew? Animal something?\"\\n\\n\"Snap.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll buy it.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s just a child\\'s game. It would be ridiculous with two.\"\\n\\n\"Show me.\"\\n\\n\"Well each of us chooses an animal.\"\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'m a dog and you\\'re a hen. Now what?\"\\n\\nTony explained.\\n\\n\"I\\'d say it was one of those games that you have to feel pretty good\\nfirst, before you can enjoy them,\" said Mrs Rattery. \"But I\\'ll try\\nanything.\"\\n\\nThey each took a pack and began dealing. Soon a pair of eights appeared.\\n\"Bow-wow,\" said Mrs Rattery, scooping in the cards.\\n\\nAnother pair, \"Bow-wow,\" said Mrs Rattery. \"You know you aren\\'t putting\\nyour heart into this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Tony. \"Coop-coop-coop.\"\\n\\nPresently he said again, \"Coop-coop-coop.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be dumb,\" said Mrs Rattery, \"that isn\\'t a pair...\"\\n\\nThey were still playing when Albert came in to draw the curtains. Tony\\nhad only two cards left which he turned over regularly; Mrs Rattery was\\nobliged to divide hers, they were too many to hold. They stopped playing\\nwhen they found that Albert was in the room.\\n\\n\"What must that man have thought?\" said Tony, when he had gone out.\\n\\n(\"Sitting there clucking like a \\'en,\" Albert reported, \"and the little\\nfellow lying dead upstairs.\")\\n\\n\"We\\'d better stop.\"\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t a very good game. And to think it\\'s the only one you know.\"\\n\\nShe collected the cards and began to deal them into their proper packs.\\nAmbrose and Albert brought in tea. Tony looked at his watch. \"Five\\no\\'clock. Now that the shutters are up we shan\\'t hear the chimes. Jock\\nmust be in London by now.\"\\n\\nMrs Rattery said, \"I\\'d rather like some whisky.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nJock had not seen Brenda\\'s flat. It was in a large, featureless house,\\ntypical of the district. Mrs Beaver deplored the space wasted by the\\nwell staircase and empty, paved hall. There was no porter; a woman came\\nthree mornings a week with bucket and mop. A board painted with the\\nnames of the tenants informed Jock that Brenda was IN. But he put little\\nreliance on this information, knowing that Brenda was not one to\\nremember, as she came in and out, to change the indicator. He found her\\nfront door on the second floor. After the first flight the staircase\\nchanged from marble to a faded carpet that had been there before Mrs\\nBeaver undertook the reconstruction. Jock pressed the bell and heard it\\nringing just inside the door. Nobody came to open it. It was past five,\\nand he had not expected to find Brenda at home. He had decided on the\\nroad up that after trying the flat, he would go to his club and ring up\\nvarious friends of Brenda\\'s who might know where she was. He rang again,\\nfrom habit, and waited a little; then turned to go. But at that moment\\nthe door next to Brenda\\'s opened and a dark lady in a dress of crimson\\nvelvet looked out at him; she wore very large earrings of oriental\\nfiligree, set with bosses of opaque, valueless stone.\\n\\n\"Are you looking for Lady Brenda Last?\"\\n\\n\"I am. Is she a friend of yours?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _such_ a friend,\" said Princess Abdul Akbar.\\n\\n\"Then perhaps you can tell me where I can find her?\"\\n\\n\"I think she\\'s bound to be at Lady Cockpurse\\'s. I\\'m just going there\\nmyself. Can I give her any message?\"\\n\\n\"I had better come and see her.\"\\n\\n\"Well, wait five minutes and you can go with me. Come inside.\"\\n\\nThe Princess\\'s single room was furnished promiscuously and with truly\\nEastern disregard of the right properties of things; swords meant to\\nadorn the state robes of a Moorish caid were swung from the picture\\nrail; mats made for prayer were strewn on the divan; the carpet on the\\nfloor had been made in Bokhara as a wall covering; while over the\\ndressing table was draped a shawl made in Yokohama for sale to\\ncruise-passengers; an octagonal table from Port Said held a Tibetan\\nBuddha of pale soapstone; six ivory elephants from Bombay stood along\\nthe top of the radiator. Other cultures, too, were represented by a set\\nof Lalique bottles and powder boxes, a phallic fetish from Senegal, a\\nDutch copper bowl, a waste-paper basket made of varnished aquatint, a\\ngolliwog presented at the gala dinner of a seaside hotel, a dozen or so\\nframed photographs of the Princess, a garden scene ingeniously\\nconstructed in pieces of coloured wood, and a radio set in fumed oak,\\nTudor style. In so small a room the effect was distracting. The Princess\\nsat at the looking-glass, Jock behind her on the divan.\\n\\n\"What\\'s your name?\" she asked over her shoulder. He told her. \"Oh yes,\\nI\\'ve heard them mention you. I was at Hetton the week-end before last...\\nsuch a quaint old place.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d better tell you. There\\'s been a frightful accident there this\\nmorning.\"\\n\\nJenny Abdul Akbar spun round on the leather stool; her eyes were wide\\nwith alarm, her hand pressed to her heart.\\n\\n\"Quick,\" she whispered, \"_tell me_. I can\\'t bear it. Is it _death_?\"\\n\\nJock nodded. \"Their little boy... kicked by a horse.\"\\n\\n\"_Little Jimmy._\"\\n\\n\"John.\"\\n\\n\"John... _dead_. It\\'s _too_ horrible.\"\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t anybody\\'s fault.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Jenny. \"It was. It was _my_ fault. I ought never to have\\ngone there... a terrible curse hangs over me. Wherever I go I bring\\nnothing but sorrow... if only it was _I_ that was dead... I shall\\nnever be able to face them again. I feel like a murderess... that brave\\nlittle life snuffed out.\"\\n\\n\"I say, you know, really, I shouldn\\'t take that line about it.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t the first time it\\'s happened... always, anywhere, I am hunted\\ndown... without remorse. O God,\" said Jenny Abdul Akbar. \"What have I\\ndone to deserve it?\"\\n\\nShe rose to leave him; there was nowhere she could go except the\\nbathroom. Jock said, through the door, \"Well, I must go along to Polly\\'s\\nand see Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"Wait a minute and I\\'ll come too.\" She had brightened a little when she\\nemerged. \"Have you got a car here,\" she asked, \"or shall I ring up a\\ntaxi?\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nAfter tea Mr Tendril called. Tony saw him in his study and was away half\\nan hour. When he returned he went to the tray, which, on Mrs Rattery\\'s\\ninstructions, had been left in the library, and poured himself out\\nwhisky and ginger ale. Mrs Rattery had resumed her patience. \"Bad\\ninterview?\" she asked, without looking up.\\n\\n\"Awful.\" He drank the whisky quickly and poured out some more.\\n\\n\"Bring me one too, will you?\"\\n\\nTony said, \"I only wanted to see him about arrangements. He tried to be\\ncomforting. It was very painful... after all the last thing one wants\\nto talk about at a time like this is religion.\"\\n\\n\"Some like it,\" said Mrs Rattery.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Tony began, after a pause, \"when you haven\\'t got children\\nyourself--\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got two sons,\" said Mrs Rattery.\\n\\n\"Have you? I\\'m so sorry. I didn\\'t realize... we know each other so\\nlittle. How very impertinent of me.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. People are always surprised. I don\\'t see them often.\\nThey\\'re at school somewhere. I took them to the cinema last summer.\\nThey\\'re getting quite big. One\\'s going to be good-looking, I think. His\\nfather is.\"\\n\\n\"Quarter-past six,\" said Tony. \"He\\'s bound to have told her by now.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThere was a little party at Lady Cockpurse\\'s, Veronica and Daisy and\\nSybil, Souki de Foucald-Esterhazy, and four or five others, all women.\\nThey were there to consult a new fortune-teller called Mrs Northcote.\\nMrs Beaver had discovered her and for every five guineas that she earned\\nat her introduction Mrs Beaver took a commission of two pounds twelve\\nand sixpence. She told fortunes in a new way, by reading the soles of\\nthe feet. They waited their turn impatiently. \"What a time she is taking\\nover Daisy.\"\\n\\n\"She is very thorough,\" said Polly, \"and it tickles rather.\"\\n\\nPresently Daisy emerged. \"What was she like?\" they asked.\\n\\n\"I mustn\\'t tell or it spoils it all,\" said Daisy.\\n\\nThey had dealt cards for precedence. It was Brenda\\'s turn now. She went\\nnext door to Mrs Northcote, who was sitting at a stool beside an\\narmchair. She was a dowdy, middle-aged woman with a slightly genteel\\naccent. Brenda sat down and took off her shoe and stocking. Mrs\\nNorthcote laid the foot on her knee and gazed at it with great\\nsolemnity; then she picked it up and began tracing the small creases of\\nthe sole with the point of a silver pencil case. Brenda wriggled her\\ntoes luxuriously and settled down to listen.\\n\\nNext door they said, \"Where\\'s Mr Beaver to-day?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s flown over to France with his mother to see some new wallpapers.\\nShe\\'s been worrying all day thinking he\\'s had an accident.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s all very touching, isn\\'t it? Though I can\\'t see his point\\nmyself...\"\\n\\n\"You must never do anything on Thursdays,\" said Mrs Northcote.\\n\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing important. You are intellectual, imaginative, sympathetic,\\neasily led by others, impulsive, affectionate. You are highly artistic\\nand are not giving full scope to your capabilities.\"\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t there anything about love?\"\\n\\n\"I am coming to love. All these lines from the great toe to the instep\\nrepresent lovers.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, go on some more about that...\"\\n\\nPrincess Abdul Akbar was announced. \"Where\\'s Brenda?\" she said. \"I\\nthought she\\'d be here.\"\\n\\n\"Mrs Northcote\\'s doing her now.\"\\n\\n\"Jock Menzies wants to see her. He\\'s downstairs.\"\\n\\n\"Darling Jock... Why on earth didn\\'t you bring him up?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s something terribly important. He\\'s got to see Brenda alone.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, how mysterious. Well, she won\\'t be long now. We can\\'t disturb\\nthem. It would upset Mrs Northcote.\"\\n\\nJenny told them the news.\\n\\nOn the other side of the door, Brenda\\'s leg was beginning to feel\\nslightly chilly. \"Four men dominate your fate,\" Mrs Northcote was\\nsaying, \"one is loyal and tender but he has not yet disclosed his love,\\none is passionate and overpowering, you are a little afraid of him.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me,\" said Brenda. \"How very exciting. Who _can_ they be?\"\\n\\n\"One you must avoid; he bodes no good for you, he is steely hearted and\\nrapacious.\"\\n\\n\"I bet that\\'s my Mr Beaver, bless him.\"\\n\\nDownstairs Jock was waiting in the small front room where Polly\\'s guests\\nusually assembled before luncheon. It was five past six.\\n\\nSoon Brenda pulled on her stocking, stepped into her shoe and joined the\\nladies. \"_Most_ enjoyable,\" she pronounced. \"Why, how odd you all look.\"\\n\\n\"Jock Grant-Menzies wants to see you downstairs.\"\\n\\n\"Jock? How very extraordinary. It isn\\'t anything awful, is it?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d better go and see him.\"\\n\\nSuddenly Brenda became frightened by the strange air of the room and the\\nunfamiliar expression in her friends\\' faces. She ran downstairs to the\\nroom where Jock was waiting.\\n\\n\"What is it, Jock? Tell me quickly, I\\'m scared. It\\'s nothing awful, is\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it is. There\\'s been a very serious accident.\"\\n\\n\"John?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Dead?\"\\n\\nHe nodded.\\n\\nShe sat down on a hard little Empire chair against the wall, perfectly\\nstill with her hands folded in her lap, like a small well-brought-up\\nchild introduced into a room full of grown-ups. She said, \"Tell me what\\nhappened. Why do you know about it first?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been down at Hetton since the week-end.\"\\n\\n\"Hetton?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you remember? John was going hunting to-day.\"\\n\\nShe frowned, not at once taking in what he was saying. \"John... John\\nAndrew... I... oh, thank God...\" Then she burst into tears.\\n\\nShe wept helplessly, turning round in the chair and pressing her\\nforehead against its gilt back.\\n\\nUpstairs Mrs Northcote had Souki Foucauld-Esterhazy by the foot and was\\nsaying, \"There are four men dominating your fate. One is loyal and\\ntender but has not yet disclosed his love...\"\\n\\n\\n[VII]\\n\\nIn the silence of Hetton, the telephone rang near the housekeeper\\'s room\\nand was switched through to the library. Tony answered it.\\n\\n\"This is Jock speaking. I\\'ve just seen Brenda. She\\'s coming down by the\\nseven o\\'clock train.\"\\n\\n\"Is she terribly upset?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, naturally.\"\\n\\n\"Where is she now?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s with me. I\\'m speaking from Polly\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I talk to her?\"\\n\\n\"Better not.\"\\n\\n\"All right... I\\'ll meet that train. Are you coming too?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ve been wonderful. I don\\'t know what I should have done\\nwithout you and Mrs Rattery.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right. I\\'ll see Brenda off.\"\\n\\nShe had stopped crying and sat crouched in the chair. She did not look\\nup while Jock telephoned. Then she said, \"Yes, I\\'ll go by that train.\"\\n\\n\"We ought to start. I suppose you will have to get some things from the\\nflat.\"\\n\\n\"My bag... upstairs. You get it. I can\\'t go in there again.\"\\n\\nShe did not speak on her way to her flat. She sat beside Jock as he\\ndrove, looking straight ahead. When they arrived she unlocked her door\\nand led him in. The room was extremely empty of furniture. She sat down\\nin the only chair. \"There\\'s plenty of time really. Tell me exactly what\\nhappened.\"\\n\\nJock told her.\\n\\n\"Poor little boy,\" she said. \"Poor little boy.\"\\n\\nThen she opened her cupboard and began to put a few things into a\\nsuitcase; she went in and out from the bathroom once or twice. \"That\\'s\\neverything,\" she said. \"There\\'s still too much time.\"\\n\\n\"Would you like anything to eat?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, nothing to eat.\" She sat down again and looked at herself in the\\nglass. She did not attempt to do anything to her face. \"When you first\\ntold me,\" she said. \"I didn\\'t understand. I didn\\'t know what I was\\nsaying.\"\\n\\n\"I know.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t say anything, did I?\"\\n\\n\"You know what you said.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know... I didn\\'t mean... I don\\'t think it\\'s any good trying to\\nexplain.\"\\n\\nJock said, \"Are you sure you\\'ve got everything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s everything,\" she nodded towards the little case on the bed.\\nShe looked quite hopeless.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'d better go to the station.\"\\n\\n\"All right. It\\'s early. But it doesn\\'t matter.\"\\n\\nJock took her to the train. As it was Wednesday the carriages were full\\nof women returning after their day\\'s shopping.\\n\\n\"Why not go first-class?\"\\n\\n\"No, no. I always go third.\"\\n\\nShe sat in the middle of a row. The women on either side looked at her\\ncuriously, wondering if she were ill.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want anything to read?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing to read.\"\\n\\n\"Or eat?\"\\n\\n\"Or eat.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll say good-bye.\"\\n\\n\"Good-bye.\"\\n\\nAnother woman pushed past Jock into the carriage, laden with light\\nparcels.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nWhen the news became known, Marjorie said to Allan, \"Well, anyway, this\\nwill mean the end of Mr Beaver.\"\\n\\nBut Polly Cockpurse said to Veronica, \"That\\'s the end of Tony so far as\\nBrenda is concerned.\"\\n\\nThe impoverished Lasts were stunned by the telegram. They lived on an\\nextensive but unprofitable chicken farm near Princes Risborough. It did\\nnot enter the heads of any of them that now, if anything happened, they\\nwere the heirs to Hetton. Had it done so, their grief would have been\\njust as keen.\\n\\nJock drove from Paddington to Bratt\\'s. One of the men by the bar said,\\n\"Ghastly thing about Tony Last\\'s boy.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I was there.\"\\n\\n\"No, were you? What a ghastly thing.\"\\n\\nLater a telephone message came: \"Princess Abdul Akbar wishes to know\\nwhether you are in the club.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, tell her I\\'m not here,\" said Jock.\\n\\n\\n[VIII]\\n\\nThe inquest was held at eleven o\\'clock next morning; it was soon over.\\nThe doctor, the bus-driver, Ben and Miss Ripon gave evidence. Miss Ripon\\nwas allowed to remain seated. She was very white and spoke in a\\ntrembling voice; her father glared at her from a nearby seat; under her\\nhat was a small bare patch, where they had shaved off her hair to clean\\nher cut. In his summary the coroner remarked that it was clear from the\\nevidence that nobody was in any way to blame for the misadventure; it\\nonly remained to express the deep sympathy of the court to Mr Last and\\nLady Brenda in their terrible loss. The people fell back to allow Tony\\nand Brenda to leave the room. Colonel Inch and the hunt secretary were\\nboth present. Everything was done with delicacy and to show respect for\\ntheir sorrow.\\n\\nBrenda said, \"Wait a minute. I must just speak to that poor Ripon girl.\"\\n\\nShe did it charmingly. When everyone had gone. Tony said, \"I wish you\\nhad been here yesterday. There were so many people about and I didn\\'t\\nknow what to say to them.\"\\n\\n\"What did you do all day?\"\\n\\n\"There was the Shameless Blonde... we played animal snap some of the\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"Animal snap? Was that any good?\"\\n\\n\"Not much... It\\'s odd to think that yesterday this time it hadn\\'t\\nhappened.\"\\n\\n\"Poor little boy,\" said Brenda.\\n\\nThey had scarcely spoken to each other since Brenda\\'s arrival. Tony had\\ndriven to the station to meet her; by the time they reached the house\\nMrs Rattery had gone to bed; that morning she left in her aeroplane\\nwithout seeing either of them. They heard the machine pass over the\\nhouse, Brenda in her bath, Tony downstairs in his study attending to the\\ncorrespondence that had become necessary.\\n\\nA day of fitful sunshine and blustering wind; white and grey clouds were\\nscarcely moving, high overhead, but the bare trees round the house\\nswayed and shook and there were swift whirlpools of straw in the stable\\nyard. Ben changed from the Sunday suit he had worn at the inquest and\\nwent about his duties. Thunderclap, too, had been kicked yesterday and\\nwas very slightly lame in the off fore.\\n\\nBrenda took off her hat and threw it down on a chair in the hall.\\n\"Nothing to say, is there?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no need to talk.\"\\n\\n\"No. I suppose there\\'ll have to be a funeral.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Yes: to-morrow?\"\\n\\nShe looked into the morning-room. \"They\\'ve done quite a lot, haven\\'t\\nthey?\"\\n\\nAll Brenda\\'s movements were slower than usual and her voice was flat and\\nexpressionless. She sank down into one of the armchairs in the centre of\\nthe hall, which nobody ever used. She sat there doing nothing. Tony put\\nhis hand on her shoulder but she said \"Don\\'t\", not impatiently or\\nnervously but without any expression. Tony said, \"I\\'ll go and finish\\nthose letters.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"See you at luncheon.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\nShe rose, looked round listlessly for her hat, found it and went very\\nslowly upstairs, the sunlight through the stained-glass windows glowing\\nand sparkling all about her.\\n\\nIn her room she sat on the window seat, looking out across the meadows\\nand dun ploughland, the naked tossing trees, the church towers, the\\nmaelstroms of dust and leaf which eddied about the terrace below; she\\nstill held her hat and fidgeted with her fingers on the brooch which was\\nclipped to one side of it.\\n\\nNanny knocked at the door and came in, red eyed. \"If you please, my\\nlady, I\\'ve been going through John\\'s things. There\\'s this handkerchief\\ndoesn\\'t belong to him.\"\\n\\nThe heavy scent and crowned cipher at the corner proclaimed its origin.\\n\\n\"I know whose it is. I\\'ll send it back to her.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t think how it came to be there,\" said nanny.\\n\\n\"Poor little boy. Poor little boy,\" said Brenda to herself, when nanny\\nhad left her, and gazed out across the troubled landscape.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"I was thinking about the pony, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, Ben?\"\\n\\n\"Will you want to be keeping her now?\"\\n\\n\"I hadn\\'t thought... no, I suppose not.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Westmacott over at Restall was asking about her. He thought she\\nmight do for his little girl.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How much shall we be asking?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know... whatever you think is right.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s a good little pony and she\\'s always been treated well. I don\\'t\\nthink she ought to go under twenty-five quid, sir.\"\\n\\n\"All right, Ben, you see about it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll ask thirty, shall I, sir, and come down a bit?\"\\n\\n\"Do just what you think best.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, sir.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nAt luncheon Tony said, \"Jock rang up. He wanted to know if there was\\nanything he could do.\"\\n\\n\"How sweet of him. Why don\\'t you have him down for the week-end?\"\\n\\n\"Would you like that?\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t be here. I\\'m going to Veronica\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to Veronica\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, don\\'t you remember?\"\\n\\nThere were servants in the room so that they said nothing more until\\nlater, when they were alone in the library. Then, \"Are you really going\\naway?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I can\\'t stay here. You understand that, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course. I was thinking we might both go away, abroad\\nsomewhere.\"\\n\\nBrenda did not answer him but continued in her own line. \"I couldn\\'t\\nstay here. It\\'s all over, don\\'t you see, our life down here.\"\\n\\n\"Darling, what _do_ you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask me to explain... not just now.\"\\n\\n\"But, Brenda, sweet, I don\\'t understand. We\\'re both young. Of course, we\\ncan never forget John. He\\'ll always be our eldest son, but...\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t go on, Tony, please don\\'t go on.\"\\n\\nSo Tony stopped and after a time said, \"So you\\'re going to Veronica\\'s\\nto-morrow?\"\\n\\n\"Mmmm.\"\\n\\n\"I think I will ask Jock to come.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I should.\"\\n\\n\"And we can think about plans later when we\\'ve got more used to things.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, later.\"\\n\\nNext morning.\\n\\n\"A sweet letter from mother,\" said Brenda, handing it across. Lady St\\nCloud had written:\\n\\n    ...I shall not come down to Hetton for the funeral, but I shall\\n    be thinking of you both all the time and of my dear grandson. I\\n    shall think of you as I saw you all three, together, at\\n    Christmas. Dear children, at a time like this only yourselves\\n    can be any help to each other. Love is the only thing that is\\n    stronger than sorrow...\\n\\n\"I got a telegram from Jock,\" said Tony, \"he _can_ come.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s really rather embarrassing for us all, Brenda coming,\" said\\nVeronica. \"I do think she might have chucked. I shan\\'t in the least know\\nwhat to say to her.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTony said to Jock, as they sat alone after dinner, \"I\\'ve been trying to\\nunderstand, and I think I do now. It\\'s not how I feel myself, but Brenda\\nand I are quite different in lots of ways. It\\'s _because_ they were\\nstrangers and didn\\'t know John, and were never in our life here, that\\nshe wants to be with them. That\\'s it, don\\'t you think? She wants to be\\nabsolutely alone and away from everything that reminds her of what has\\nhappened... all the same I feel awful about letting her go. I can\\'t\\ntell you what she was like here... quite mechanical. It\\'s so much worse\\nfor her than it is for me, I see that. It\\'s so terrible not being able\\nto do anything to help.\"\\n\\nJock did not answer.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBeaver was staying at Veronica\\'s. Brenda said to him, \"Until Wednesday,\\nwhen I thought something had happened to you, I had no idea that I loved\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Well you\\'ve said it often enough.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to make you understand,\" said Brenda. \"You clod.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nOn Monday morning Tony found this letter on his breakfast tray.\\n\\n    Darling Tony,\\n\\n    I am not coming back to Hetton. Grimshawe can pack everything\\n    and bring it to the flat. Then I shan\\'t want her any more.\\n\\n    You must have realized for some time that things were going\\n    wrong.\\n\\n    I am in love with John Beaver and I want to have a divorce and\\n    marry him. If John Andrew had not died things might not have\\n    happened like this. I can\\'t tell. As it is, I simply can\\'t begin\\n    over again. Please do not mind too much. I suppose we shan\\'t be\\n    allowed to meet while the case is on but I hope afterwards we\\n    shall be great friends. Anyway, I shall always look on you as\\n    one whatever you think of me.\\n\\n    Best love from\\n    Brenda.\\n\\nWhen Tony read this his first thought was that Brenda had lost her\\nreason. \"She\\'s only seen Beaver twice to my knowledge,\" he said.\\n\\nBut later he showed the letter to Jock, who said, \"I\\'m sorry it should\\nhave happened like this.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s not true, is it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m afraid it is. Everyone has known for some time.\"\\n\\nBut it was several days before Tony fully realized what it meant. He had\\ngot into a habit of loving and trusting Brenda.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\nENGLISH GOTHIC--II\\n\\n\\n[I]\\n\\n\"How\\'s the old boy taking it?\"\\n\\n\"Not so well. It makes me feel rather a beast,\" said Brenda. \"I\\'m afraid\\nhe minds a lot.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you wouldn\\'t like it if he didn\\'t,\" said Polly to console her.\\n\\n\"No, I suppose not.\"\\n\\n\"I shall stick by you whatever happens,\" said Jenny Abdul Akbar.\\n\\n\"Oh, everything is going quite smoothly now,\" said Brenda. \"There was a\\ncertain amount of _g?ne_ with relatives.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTony had been living with Jock for the last three weeks. Mrs Rattery had\\ngone to California and he was grateful for company. They dined together\\nmost evenings. They had given up going to Bratt\\'s; so had Beaver; they\\nwere afraid of meeting each other. Instead, Tony and Jock went to\\nBrown\\'s, where Beaver was not a member. Beaver was continually with\\nBrenda nowadays, at one of half a dozen houses.\\n\\nMrs Beaver did not like the turn things had taken; her workmen had been\\nsent back from Hetton with their job unfinished.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nIn the first week Tony had had several distasteful interviews. Allan had\\nattempted to act as peacemaker.\\n\\n\"You just wait a few weeks,\" he had said. \"Brenda will come back. She\\'ll\\nsoon get sick of Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want her back.\"\\n\\n\"I know just how you feel, but it doesn\\'t do to be medieval about it. If\\nBrenda hadn\\'t been upset at John\\'s death this need never have come to a\\ncrisis. Why, last year Marjorie was going everywhere with that ass Robin\\nBeaseley. She was mad about him at the time, but I pretended not to\\nnotice and it all blew over. If I were you I should refuse to recognize\\nthat anything has happened.\"\\n\\nMarjorie had said, \"Of _course_ Brenda doesn\\'t love Beaver. How could\\nshe?... And if she thinks she does at the moment, it\\'s your duty to\\nprevent her making a fool of herself. You must refuse to be\\ndivorced--anyway, until she has found someone more reasonable.\"\\n\\nLady St Cloud had said, \"Brenda has been very, very foolish. She always\\nwas an excitable girl, but I am sure there was never anything _wrong_,\\nquite sure. _That_ wouldn\\'t be like Brenda at all. I haven\\'t met Mr\\nBeaver and I do not wish to. I understand he is unsuitable in every way.\\nBrenda would never want to marry anyone like that. I will tell you\\nexactly how it happened, Tony. Brenda must have felt a tiny bit\\nneglected--people often do at that stage of marriage. I have known\\ncountless cases--and it was naturally flattering to find a young man to\\nbeg and carry for her. That\\'s all it was, nothing _wrong_. And then the\\nterrible shock of little John\\'s accident unsettled her and she didn\\'t\\nknow what she was saying or writing. You\\'ll both laugh over this little\\nfracas in years to come.\"\\n\\nTony had not set eyes on Brenda since the afternoon of the funeral. Once\\nhe spoke to her over the telephone.\\n\\nIt was during the second week when he was feeling most lonely and\\nbewildered by various counsels. Allan had been with him urging a\\nreconciliation. \"I\\'ve been talking to Brenda,\" he had said. \"She\\'s sick\\nof Beaver already. The one thing she wants is to go back to Hetton and\\nsettle down with you again.\"\\n\\nWhile Allan was there, Tony resolutely refused to listen, but later the\\nwords, and the picture they evoked, would not leave his mind. So he rang\\nher up and she answered him calmly and gravely.\\n\\n\"Brenda, this is Tony.\"\\n\\n\"Hullo, Tony, what is it?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been talking to Allan. He\\'s just told me about your change of\\nmind.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure I know what you mean.\"\\n\\n\"That you want to leave Beaver and come back to Hetton.\"\\n\\n\"Did Allan say that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; isn\\'t it true?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it\\'s not. Allan is an interfering ass. I had him here this\\nafternoon. He told me that you didn\\'t want a divorce but that you were\\nwilling to let me stay on alone in London and do as I liked provided\\nthere was no public scandal. It seemed a good idea and I was going to\\nring you up about it. But I suppose that\\'s just his diplomacy too.\\nAnyway, I\\'m afraid there\\'s no prospect of my coming back to Hetton just\\nat present.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see. I didn\\'t think it was likely... I just rang you up.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. How are you, Tony?\"\\n\\n\"All right, thanks.\"\\n\\n\"Good, so am I. Good-bye.\"\\n\\nThat was all he had heard of her. Both avoided places where there was a\\nlikelihood of their meeting.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nIt was thought convenient that Brenda should appear as the plaintiff.\\nTony did not employ the family solicitors in the matter but another less\\nreputable firm who specialized in divorce. He had steeled himself to\\nexpect a certain professional gusto, even levity, but found them instead\\ndisposed to melancholy and suspicion.\\n\\n\"I gather Lady Brenda is being far from discreet. It is quite likely\\nthat the King\\'s Proctor may intervene... Moreover, there is the\\nquestion of money. You understand that by the present arrangement since\\nshe is the innocent and injured party she will be entitled to claim\\nsubstantial alimony from the courts?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" said Tony. \"I\\'ve been into all that with her\\nbrother-in-law and have decided to make a settlement of five hundred a\\nyear. She has four hundred of her own and I understand Mr Beaver has\\nsomething.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity we can\\'t put it in writing,\" said the solicitor, \"but that\\nmight constitute Conspiracy.\"\\n\\n\"Lady Brenda\\'s word is quite good enough,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"We like to protect our clients against even the most remote\\ncontingencies,\" said the lawyer with an air of piety, for he had not had\\nTony\\'s opportunities to contract the habit of loving and trusting\\nBrenda.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThe fourth week-end after Brenda\\'s departure from Hetton was fixed for\\nTony\\'s infidelity. A suite was engaged at a seaside hotel (\"We always\\nsend our clients there. The servants are well accustomed to giving\\nevidence\") and private detectives were notified. \"It only remains to\\nselect a partner,\" said the solicitor; no hint of naughtiness lightened\\nhis gloom. \"We have on occasions been instrumental in accommodating our\\nclients but there have been frequent complaints, so we find it best to\\nleave the choice to them. Lately we had a particularly delicate case\\ninvolving a man of very rigid morality and a certain diffidence. In the\\nend his own wife consented to go with him and supply the evidence. She\\nwore a red wig. It was quite successful.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that would do in this case.\"\\n\\n\"No. Exactly. I was merely quoting it as a matter of interest.\"\\n\\n\"I expect I shall be able to find someone,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said the solicitor, bowing politely.\\n\\nBut when he came to discuss the question later with Jock, it did not\\nseem so easy. \"It\\'s not a thing one can ask every girl to do,\" he said,\\n\"whichever way you put it. If you say it is merely a legal form it is\\nrather insulting, and if you suggest going the whole hog it\\'s rather\\nfresh--suddenly, I mean, if you\\'ve never paid any particular attention\\nto her before and don\\'t propose to carry on with it afterwards... Of\\ncourse there\\'s always old Sybil.\"\\n\\nBut even Sybil refused. \"I\\'d do it like a shot any other time,\" she\\nsaid, \"but just at the moment it wouldn\\'t suit my book. There\\'s a\\ncertain person who might hear about it and take it wrong... There\\'s an\\nawfully pretty girl called Jenny Abdul Akbar. I wonder if you\\'ve met\\nher.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve met her.\"\\n\\n\"Well, won\\'t she do?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear, I don\\'t know who to suggest.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'d better go and study the market at the Old Hundredth,\" said Jock.\\n\\nThey dined at Jock\\'s house. Lately they had found it a little gloomy at\\nBrown\\'s, for people tended to avoid anyone they knew to be unhappy.\\nThough they drank a magnum of champagne they could not recapture the\\nlight-hearted mood in which they had last visited Sink Street. And then\\nTony said, \"Is it any good going there yet?\"\\n\\n\"We may as well try. After all, we aren\\'t going there for enjoyment.\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed.\"\\n\\nThe doors were open at a Hundred Sink Street and the band was playing to\\nan empty ballroom. The waiters were eating at a little table in the\\ncorner. Two or three girls were clustered round the Jack-Pot machine,\\nlosing shillings hard and complaining about the cold. They ordered a\\nbottle of the Montmorency Wine Company\\'s brand and sat down to wait.\\n\\n\"Any of those do?\" asked Jock.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t much care.\"\\n\\n\"Better get someone you like. You\\'ve got to put in a lot of time with\\nher.\"\\n\\nPresently Milly and Babs came downstairs.\\n\\n\"How are the postmen\\'s hats?\" said Milly.\\n\\nThey could not recognize the allusion.\\n\\n\"You are the two boys who were here last month, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I\\'m afraid we were rather tight.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say?\" It was very seldom that Milly and Babs met anyone who\\nwas quite sober during their business hours.\\n\\n\"Well, come and sit down. How are you both?\"\\n\\n\"I think I\\'m starting a cold,\" said Babs. \"I feel awful. Why can\\'t they\\nheat this hole, the mean hounds?\"\\n\\nMilly was more cheerful and swayed in her chair to the music. \"Care to\\ndance?\" she said, and she and Tony began to shuffle across the empty\\nfloor.\\n\\n\"My friend is looking for a lady to take to the seaside,\" said Jock.\\n\\n\"What, this weather? That\\'ll be a nice treat for a lonely girl.\" Babs\\nsniffed into a little ball of a handkerchief.\\n\\n\"It\\'s for a divorce.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see. Well, why doesn\\'t he take Milly? She doesn\\'t catch cold\\neasy. Besides, she knows how to behave at an hotel. Lots of the girls\\nhere are all right to have a lark with in town, but you have to have a\\n_lady_ for a divorce.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you often get asked to do that?\"\\n\\n\"Now and then. It\\'s a nice rest--but it means so much _talking_ and the\\ngentlemen will always go on so about their wives.\"\\n\\nWhile they were dancing Tony came straight to business. \"I suppose you\\nwouldn\\'t care to come away for the week-end?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t mind,\" said Milly. \"Where?\"\\n\\n\"I thought of Brighton.\"\\n\\n\"Oh... Is it for a divorce?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t mind if I brought my little girl with us? She wouldn\\'t be\\nany trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you wouldn\\'t mind?\"\\n\\n\"I mean I should mind.\"\\n\\n\"Oh... You wouldn\\'t think I had a little girl of eight, would you?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s called Winnie. I was only sixteen when I had her. I was the\\nyoungest of the family and our stepfather wouldn\\'t leave any of us girls\\nalone. That\\'s why I have to work. She lives with a lady at Finchley.\\nTwenty-eight bob a week it costs me, not counting her clothes. She does\\nlike the seaside.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Tony. \"I\\'m sorry but it would be quite impossible. We\\'ll get\\na lovely present for you to take back to her.\"\\n\\n\"All right... One gentleman gave her a fairy-cycle for Christmas. She\\nfell off and cut her knee... When do we start?\"\\n\\n\"Would you like to go by train or car?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, train. Winnie\\'s sick if she goes in a car.\"\\n\\n\"Winnie\\'s not coming.\"\\n\\n\"No, but let\\'s go by train anyway.\"\\n\\nSo it was decided that they should meet at Victoria on Saturday\\nafternoon.\\n\\nJock gave Babs ten shillings and he and Tony went home, Tony had not\\nslept much lately. He could not prevent himself, when alone, from\\nrehearsing over and over in his mind all that had happened since\\nBeaver\\'s visit to Hetton; searching for clues he had missed at the time;\\nwondering where something he had said or done might have changed the\\ncourse of events; going back further to his earliest acquaintance with\\nBrenda to find indications that should have made him more ready to\\nunderstand the change that had come over her; reliving scene after scene\\nin the last eight years of his life. All this kept him awake.\\n\\n\\n[II]\\n\\nThere was a general rendezvous at the first-class booking office. The\\ndetectives were there earliest, ten minutes before their time. They had\\nbeen pointed out to Tony at the solicitor\\'s office so that he should not\\nlose them. They were cheerful middle-aged men in soft hats and heavy\\novercoats. They were looking forward to their week-end, for most of\\ntheir daily work consisted in standing about at street corners watching\\nfront doors, and a job of this kind was eagerly competed for in the\\noffice. In more modest divorces the solicitors were content to rely on\\nthe evidence of the hotel servants. The detectives were a luxury and\\nproposed to treat themselves as such.\\n\\nThere was a slight fog in London that day. The station lamps were alight\\nprematurely.\\n\\nTony came next, with Jock at his side, loyally there to see him off.\\nThey bought the tickets and waited. The detectives, sticklers for\\nprofessional etiquette, made an attempt at self-effacement, studying the\\nposters on the walls and peering from behind a pillar.\\n\\n\"This is going to be hell,\" said Tony.\\n\\nIt was ten minutes before Milly came. She emerged from the gloom with a\\nporter in front carrying her suitcase and a child dragging back on her\\narm behind her. Milly\\'s wardrobe consisted mainly of evening dresses,\\nfor during the day she usually spent her time sitting before a gas fire\\nin her dressing-gown. She made an insignificant and rather respectable\\nappearance. \"Sorry if I\\'m late,\" she said. \"Winnie here couldn\\'t find\\nher shoes. I brought her along too. I knew you wouldn\\'t mind really. She\\ntravels on a half ticket.\"\\n\\nWinnie was a plain child with large gold-rimmed spectacles. When she\\nspoke she revealed that two of her front teeth were missing.\\n\\n\"I hope you don\\'t imagine she\\'s coming with us.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that the idea,\" said Milly. \"She won\\'t be any trouble--she\\'s got\\nher puzzle.\"\\n\\nTony bent down to speak to the little girl. \"Listen,\" he said. \"You\\ndon\\'t want to come to a nasty big hotel. You go with this kind gentleman\\nhere. He\\'ll take you to a shop and let you choose the biggest doll you\\ncan find and then he\\'ll drive you back in his motor to your home. You\\'ll\\nlike that, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Winnie. \"I want to go to the seaside. I won\\'t go with that\\nman. I don\\'t want a doll. I want to go to the seaside with my mummy.\"\\n\\nSeveral people besides the detectives were beginning to take notice of\\nthe oddly assorted group.\\n\\n\"Oh God!\" said Tony. \"I suppose she\\'s got to come.\"\\n\\nThe detectives followed at a distance down the platform. Tony settled\\nhis companions in a Pullman car. \"Look,\" said Milly, \"we\\'re travelling\\nfirst-class. Isn\\'t that fun? We can have tea.\"\\n\\n\"Can I have an ice?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t expect they\\'ve got an ice. But you can have some nice tea.\"\\n\\n\"But I want an ice.\"\\n\\n\"You shall have an ice when you get to Brighton. Now be a good girl and\\nplay with your puzzle or mother won\\'t take you to the seaside again.\"\\n\\n\"The Awful Child of popular fiction,\" said Jock as he left Tony.\\n\\nWinnie sustained the part throughout the journey to Brighton. She was\\nnot inventive but she knew the classic routine thoroughly, even to such\\ncommonplace but alarming devices as breathing heavily, grunting and\\ncomplaining of nausea.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nRooms at the hotel had been engaged for Tony by the solicitors. It was\\ntherefore a surprise to the reception clerk when Winnie arrived. \"We\\nhave reserved in your name double and single communicating rooms,\\nbathroom and sitting-room,\" he said. \"We did not understand you were\\nbringing your daughter. Will you require a further room?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Winnie can come in with me,\" said Milly.\\n\\nThe two detectives who were standing nearby at the counter exchanged\\nglances of disapproval.\\n\\nTony wrote _Mr and Mrs Last_ in the Visitors\\' Book.\\n\\n\"And daughter,\" said the clerk with his finger on the place.\\n\\nTony hesitated. \"She is my niece,\" he said, and inscribed her name on\\nanother line, as _Miss Smith_.\\n\\nThe detective, registering below, remarked to his colleague, \"He got out\\nof that all right. Quite smart. But I don\\'t like the look of this case.\\nMost irregular. Sets a nasty, respectable note bringing a kid into it.\\nWe\\'ve got the firm to consider. It doesn\\'t do them any good to get mixed\\nup with the King\\'s Proctor.\"\\n\\n\"How about a quick one?\" said his colleague indifferently.\\n\\nUpstairs, Winnie said, \"Where\\'s the sea?\"\\n\\n\"Just there across the street.\"\\n\\n\"I want to go and see it.\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'s dark now, pet. You shall see it to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I want to see it to-night.\"\\n\\n\"You take her to see it now,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"Sure you won\\'t be lonely?\"\\n\\n\"Quite sure.\"\\n\\n\"We won\\'t be long.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right. You let her see it properly.\"\\n\\nTony went down to the bar where he was pleased to find the two\\ndetectives. He felt the need of male company. \"Good evening,\" he said.\\n\\nThey looked at him askance. Everything in this case seemed to be\\nhappening as though with deliberate design to shock their professional\\nfeelings. \"Good evening,\" said the senior detective. \"Nasty, raw\\nevening.\"\\n\\n\"Have a drink.\"\\n\\nSince Tony was paying their expenses in any case, the offer seemed\\nsuperfluous, but the junior detective brightened instinctively and said,\\n\"Don\\'t mind if I do.\"\\n\\n\"Come and sit down. I feel rather lonely.\"\\n\\nThey took their drinks to a table out of hearing of the barman. \"Mr\\nLast, sir, this is all _wrong_,\" said the senior detective. \"You haven\\'t\\nno business to recognize us at all. I don\\'t know what they\\'d say at the\\noffice.\"\\n\\n\"Best respects,\" said the junior detective.\\n\\n\"This is Mr James, my colleague,\" said the senior detective. \"My name is\\nBlenkinsop. James is new to this kind of work.\"\\n\\n\"So am I,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"A pity we\\'ve such a nasty week-end for the job,\" said Blenkinsop, \"very\\ndamp and blowy. Gets me in the joints.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" said Tony. \"Is it usual to bring children on an expedition of\\nthis kind?\"\\n\\n\"It is _not_.\"\\n\\n\"I thought it couldn\\'t be.\"\\n\\n\"Since you ask me, Mr Last, I regard it as most irregular and\\ninjudicious. It looks wrong, and cases of this kind depend very much on\\nmaking the right impression. Of course as far as James and me are\\nconcerned, the matter is O.K. There won\\'t be a word about it in our\\nevidence. But you can\\'t trust the servants. You might very likely happen\\nto strike one who was new to the courts, who\\'d blurt it out, and then\\nwhere would we be. I don\\'t like it, Mr Last, and that\\'s the truth.\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t feel more strongly about it than I do.\"\\n\\n\"Fond of kids myself,\" said James, who was new to this kind of work.\\n\"How about one with us?\"\\n\\n\"Tell me,\" said Tony, when they had been at their table some little\\ntime. \"You must have observed numerous couples in your time, qualifying\\nfor a divorce; tell me, how do they get through their day?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s easier in the summer,\" said Blenkinsop, \"the young ladies usually\\nbathe and the gentlemen read the papers on the esplanade; some goes for\\nmotor drives and some just hangs around the bar. They\\'re mostly glad\\nwhen Monday comes.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nMilly and her child were in the sitting-room when Tony came up.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve ordered an ice,\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"Quite right.\"\\n\\n\"I want late dinner. I want late dinner.\"\\n\\n\"No, dear, not late dinner. You have an ice up here.\"\\n\\nTony returned to the bar. \"Mr James,\" he said. \"Did I understand you to\\nsay you were fond of children.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in their right place.\"\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t, I suppose, consider dining to-night with the little girl\\nwho has accompanied me? I should take it as a great kindness.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no, sir, hardly that.\"\\n\\n\"You would not find me ungrateful.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I don\\'t want to appear unobliging, but it\\'s not part of my\\nduties.\"\\n\\nHe seemed to be wavering but Blenkinsop interposed. \"Quite out of the\\nquestion, sir.\"\\n\\nWhen Tony left them Blenkinsop spoke from the depth of his experience;\\nit was the first job that he and James had been on together, and he felt\\nunder some obligation to put his junior wise. \"Our trouble is always the\\nsame--to make the clients realize that divorce is a serious matter.\"\\n\\nEventually extravagant promises for the morrow, two or three ices, and\\nthe slight depression induced by them persuaded Winnie to go to bed.\\n\\n\"How are we going to sleep?\" asked Milly.\\n\\n\"Oh, just as you like.\"\\n\\n\"Just as _you_ like.\"\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps Winnie would be happier with you... she\\'ll have to go\\ninto the other room to-morrow morning when they bring in breakfast, of\\ncourse.\"\\n\\nSo she was tucked up in a corner of the double bed and to Tony\\'s\\nsurprise was asleep before they went down to dinner.\\n\\nA change of clothes brought to both Tony and Milly a change of temper.\\nShe, in her best evening frock, backless and vermilion, her face newly\\ndone and her bleached curls brushed out, her feet in high red shoes,\\nsome bracelets on her wrist, a dab of scent behind the large sham pearls\\nin her ears, shook off the cares of domesticity and was once more in\\nuniform, reporting for duty, a legionary ordered for active service\\nafter the enervating restraints of a winter in barracks; and Tony,\\nfilling his cigar case before the mirror, and slipping it into the\\npocket of his dinner jacket, reminded himself that phantasmagoric, and\\neven gruesome as the situation might seem to him, he was nevertheless a\\nhost, so that he knocked at the communicating door and passed with a\\ncalm manner into his guest\\'s room; for a month now he had lived in a\\nworld suddenly bereft of order; it was as though the whole reasonable\\nand decent constitution of things, the sum of all he had experienced or\\nlearned to expect, were an inconspicuous, inconsiderable object mislaid\\nsomewhere on the dressing table; no outrageous circumstance in which he\\nfound himself, no new, mad thing brought to his notice, could add a jot\\nto the all-encompassing chaos that shrieked about his ears. He smiled at\\nMilly from the doorway. \"Charming,\" he said, \"perfectly charming. Shall\\nwe go down to dinner?\"\\n\\nTheir rooms were on the first floor. Step by step, with her hand on his\\narm, they descended the staircase into the bright hall below.\\n\\n\"Cheer up,\" said Milly. \"You have a tongue sandwich. That\\'ll make you\\ntalk.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry, am I being a bore?\"\\n\\n\"I was only joking. You are a serious boy, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\nIn spite of the savage weather the hotel seemed full of week-end\\nvisitors. More were arriving through the swing doors, their eyes moist\\nand their cheeks rigid from the icy cold outside.\\n\\n\"Yids,\" explained Milly superfluously. \"Still, it\\'s nice to get a change\\nfrom the club once in a while.\"\\n\\nOne of the new arrivals was a friend of Milly\\'s. He was supervising the\\ncollection of his luggage. Anywhere else he would have been a noticeable\\nfigure, for he wore a large fur coat and a beret; under the coat\\nappeared tartan stockings and black and white shoes. \"Take \"em up and\\nget \"em unpacked and quick about it,\" he said. He was a stout little\\nyoung man. His companion, also in furs, was staring resentfully at one\\nof the showcases that embellished the hall.\\n\\n\"Oh, for Christ\\'s sake,\" she said.\\n\\nMilly and the young man greeted each other. \"This is Dan,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Well, well, well,\" said Dan, \"what next?\"\\n\\n\"Do I get a drink?\" said Dan\\'s girl.\\n\\n\"Baby, you do, if I have to get it myself. Won\\'t you two join us, or are\\nwe _de trop_?\"\\n\\nThey went together into the glittering lounge. \"I\\'m cold like hell,\"\\nsaid Baby.\\n\\nDan had taken off his greatcoat and revealed a suit of smooth, purplish\\nplus-fours and a silk shirt of a pattern Tony might have chosen for\\npyjamas. \"We\\'ll soon warm you up,\" he said.\\n\\n\"This place stinks of Yids,\" said Baby.\\n\\n\"I always think that\\'s the sign of a good hotel, don\\'t you?\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"Like hell,\" said Baby.\\n\\n\"You mustn\\'t mind Baby, she\\'s cold,\" Dan explained.\\n\\n\"Who wouldn\\'t be, in your lousy car?\"\\n\\nThey had some cocktails. Then Dan and Baby went to their room; they must\\ndoll up, they explained, as they were going to a party given by a friend\\nof Dan\\'s, at a place of his near there. Tony and Milly went in to\\ndinner. \"He\\'s a very nice boy,\" she said, \"and comes to the club a lot.\\nWe get all sorts there, but Dan\\'s one of the decent ones. I was going to\\nhave gone abroad with him once but in the end he couldn\\'t get away.\"\\n\\n\"His girl didn\\'t seem to like us much.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, she was cold.\"\\n\\nTony did not find conversation easy at dinner. At first he commented on\\ntheir neighbours as he would have done if he had been dining with Brenda\\nat Espinosa\\'s. \"That\\'s a pretty girl in the corner.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder you don\\'t go and join her, dear,\" said Milly testily.\\n\\n\"Look at that woman\\'s diamonds. Do you think they can be real?\"\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you ask her, if you\\'re so interested?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s an interesting type--the dark woman dancing.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure she\\'d be delighted to hear it.\"\\n\\nPresently Tony realized that it was not etiquette in Milly\\'s world to\\nexpress interest in women, other than the one you were with.\\n\\nThey drank champagne. So also, noticed Tony with displeasure, did the\\ntwo detectives. He would have something to say about that when their\\nbill for expenses came in. It was not as though they had been\\naccommodating in the matter of Winnie. All the time, at the back of his\\nmind, he was worrying with the problem of what they could possibly do\\nafter dinner, but it was solved for him, just as he was lighting his\\ncigar, by the appearance of Dan from the other side of the dining-room.\\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"if you two aren\\'t doing anything special, why\\ndon\\'t you join up with us and come to the party at my friend\\'s place.\\nYou\\'ll like it. He always gives one the best of everything.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do let\\'s,\" said Milly.\\n\\nDan\\'s evening clothes were made of blue cloth that was supposed to\\nappear black in artificial light; for some reason, however, they\\nremained very blue.\\n\\nSo Milly and Tony went to Dan\\'s friend\\'s place and had the best of\\neverything. There was a party of twenty or thirty people, all more or\\nless like Dan. Dan\\'s friend was most hospitable. When he was not\\nfiddling with the wireless, which gave trouble off and on throughout the\\nevening, he was sauntering among his guests refilling their glasses.\\n\"This stuff\\'s all right,\" he said, showing the label, \"it won\\'t hurt\\nyou. It\\'s the right stuff.\"\\n\\nThey had a lot of the right stuff.\\n\\nQuite often Dan\\'s friend noticed that Tony seemed to be out of the\\nparty. Then he would come across and put his hand on Tony\\'s shoulder.\\n\"I\\'m so glad Dan brought you,\" he would say. \"Hope you\\'re getting all\\nyou want. Delighted to see you. Come again when there isn\\'t a crowd and\\nsee over the place. Interested in roses?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I like them very much.\"\\n\\n\"Come when the roses are out. You\\'d like that if you\\'re interested in\\nroses. Damn that radio, it\\'s going wonky again.\"\\n\\nTony wondered whether he was as amiable when people he did not know were\\nbrought over unexpectedly to Hetton.\\n\\nAt one stage in the evening he found himself sitting on a sofa with Dan,\\nwho said, \"Nice kid, Milly.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you a thing I\\'ve noticed about her. She attracts quite a\\ndifferent type from the other girls. People like you and me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t think she had a daughter of eight, would you?\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s very surprising.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know for ages. Then I was taking her to Dieppe for the\\nweek-end and she wanted to bring the child along too. Of course that put\\nthe kybosh on it, but I\\'ve always liked Milly just the same. You can\\ntrust her to behave anywhere.\" He said this with a sour glance towards\\nBaby, who was full of the right stuff and showing it.\\n\\nIt was after three before the party broke up. Dan\\'s friend renewed his\\ninvitation to come again when the roses were out. \"I doubt if you\\'ll\\nfind a better show of roses anywhere in the south of England,\" he said.\\n\\nDan drove them back to the hotel. Baby sat beside him in front, disposed\\nto be quarrelsome. \"Where were you?\" she kept asking. \"Never saw you all\\nthe evening. Where did you get to? Where were you hiding? I call it a\\nlousy way to take a girl out.\"\\n\\nTony and Milly sat at the back. From habit and exhaustion she put her\\nhead on his shoulder and her hand in his. When they reached their rooms,\\nhowever, she said, \"Go quietly. We don\\'t want to wake Winnie.\"\\n\\nFor an hour or so Tony lay in the warm little bedroom, reviewing over\\nand over again the incidents of the last three months; then he too fell\\nasleep.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nHe was awakened by Winnie. \"Mother\\'s still asleep,\" she said.\\n\\nTony looked at his watch. \"So I should think,\" he said. It was a\\nquarter-past seven. \"Go back to bed.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m dressed. Let\\'s go out.\"\\n\\nShe went to the window and pulled back the curtains, filling the room\\nwith glacial, morning light. \"It\\'s hardly raining at all,\" she said.\\n\\n\"What do you want to do?\"\\n\\n\"I want to go on the pier.\"\\n\\n\"It won\\'t be open yet.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I want to go down to the sea. Come on.\"\\n\\nTony knew that he would not get to sleep again that morning. \"All right.\\nYou go and wait while I dress.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll wait here. Mother snores so.\"\\n\\nTwenty minutes later they went downstairs into the hall where aproned\\nwaiters were piling up the furniture and brushing the carpets. A keen\\nwind met them as they emerged from the swing door. The asphalt promenade\\nwas wet with spray and rain. Two or three female figures were scudding\\nalong, bowed to the wind, prayer-books clutched in their gloved hands.\\nFour or five rugged old men were hobbling down to bathe, hissing like\\nostlers. \"Oh, come on,\" said Winnie.\\n\\nThey went down to the beach and stumbled painfully across the shingle to\\nthe margin of the sea. Winnie threw some stones. The bathers were in the\\nwater now; some of them had dogs who swam snorting beside them.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you bathe?\" asked Winnie.\\n\\n\"Far too cold.\"\\n\\n\"But _they\\'re_ bathing. I want to.\"\\n\\n\"You must ask your mother.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you\\'re afraid. Can you swim?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you? Bet you can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"All right. I can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Then why did you say you could. Fibber.\"\\n\\nThey walked along the shingle. Winnie slithered about astride a\\nbackwater. \"Now my knickers are wet,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Better come back and change.\"\\n\\n\"It feels horrible. Let\\'s go and have breakfast.\"\\n\\nThe hotel did not, as a rule, cater for guests who breakfasted\\ndownstairs at eight o\\'clock on Sunday morning. It took a long time\\nbefore anything could be got ready. There were no ices, much to Winnie\\'s\\nannoyance. She ate grapefruit and kippers and scrambled eggs on toast,\\ncomplaining fitfully about her wet clothing. After breakfast Tony sent\\nher upstairs to change and himself smoked a pipe in the lounge and\\nglanced over the Sunday papers. Here at nine o\\'clock he was interrupted\\nby the arrival of Blenkinsop. \"We missed you last night,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We went to a party.\"\\n\\n\"You shouldn\\'t have done that--not strictly, but I daresay no harm will\\ncome of it. Have you had your breakfast?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in the dining-room with Winnie.\"\\n\\n\"But, Mr Last, what are you thinking of? You\\'ve got to get evidence from\\nthe hotel servants.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I didn\\'t like to wake Milly.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s paid for it, isn\\'t she? Come, come, Mr Last, this won\\'t do at\\nall. You\\'ll never get your divorce if you don\\'t give your mind to it\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Tony. \"I\\'ll have breakfast again.\"\\n\\n\"In bed, mind.\"\\n\\n\"In bed.\" And he went wearily upstairs to his rooms.\\n\\nWinnie had drawn the curtains but her mother was still asleep. \"She woke\\nup once and then turned over. Do get her to come out. I want to go on\\nthe pier.\"\\n\\n\"Milly,\" said Tony firmly. \"Milly.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"What time is it?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to have breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t want any breakfast. I think I\\'ll sleep a little.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve had breakfast,\" said Winnie.\\n\\n\"Come on,\" said Tony. \"Plenty of time to sleep afterwards. This is what\\nwe came for.\"\\n\\nMilly sat up in bed. \"O.K.,\" she said. \"Winnie, darling, give mother her\\njacket off the chair.\" She was a conscientious girl, ready to go through\\nwith her job, however unattractive it might seem. \"But it\\'s early.\"\\n\\nTony went into his room and took off his shoes, collar and tie, coat and\\nwaistcoat, and put on a dressing-gown.\\n\\n\"You are greedy,\" said Winnie, \"eating two breakfasts.\"\\n\\n\"When you\\'re a little older you\\'ll understand these things. It\\'s the\\nLaw. Now I want you to stay in the sitting-room for a quarter of an hour\\nvery quietly. Promise? And afterwards you can do exactly what you like.\"\\n\\n\"Can I bathe?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, certainly, if you\\'re quiet now.\"\\n\\nTony got into bed beside Milly and pulled the dressing-gown tight round\\nhis throat. \"Does that look all right?\"\\n\\n\"Love\\'s young dream,\" said Milly.\\n\\n\"All right, then. I\\'ll ring the bell.\"\\n\\nWhen the tray had been brought, Tony got out of bed and put on his\\nthings. \"So much for my infidelity,\" he said. \"It is curious to reflect\\nthat this will be described in the papers as \"intimacy\".\"\\n\\n\"Can I bathe now?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\nMilly turned over to sleep again. Tony took Winnie to the beach. The\\nwind had got up and a heavy sea was pounding on the shingle.\\n\\n\"This little girl would like to bathe,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"No bathing for children to-day,\" said the beach attendant.\\n\\n\"The very idea,\" said various onlookers. \"Does he want to drown the\\nchild?\" \"He\\'s no business to be trusted with children.\" \"_Unnatural\\nbeast._\"\\n\\n\"But I _want_ to bathe,\" said Winnie. \"You said I could bathe if you had\\ntwo breakfasts.\"\\n\\nThe people who had clustered round to witness Tony\\'s discomfort, looked\\nat one another askance. \"Two breakfasts? Wanting to let the child bathe?\\nThe man\\'s balmy.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said Tony. \"We\\'ll go on the pier.\"\\n\\nSeveral of the crowd followed them round the slots, curious to see what\\nnew enormity this mad father might attempt. \"There\\'s a man who\\'s eaten\\ntwo breakfasts and tries to drown his little girl,\" they informed other\\nspectators, sceptically observing his attempts to amuse Winnie with\\nskee-ball. Tony\\'s conduct confirmed the view of human nature derived\\nfrom the weekly newspapers which they had all been reading that morning.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Brenda\\'s solicitor. \"We have our case now, all quite\\nregular and complete. I don\\'t think it can come on until next\\nterm--there\\'s a great rush at the moment, but there\\'s no harm in you\\nhaving your own evidence ready. I\\'ve got it typed out for you. You\\'d\\nbetter keep it by you and get it clear in your mind.\"\\n\\n\"_...My marriage was an ideally happy one_,\" she read \"_until shortly\\nbefore Christmas last year when I began to suspect that my husband\\'s\\nattitude had changed towards me. He always remained in the country when\\nmy studies took me to London. I realized that he no longer cared for me\\nas he used to. He began to drink heavily and on one occasion made a\\ndisturbance at our flat in London, constantly ringing up when drunk and\\nsending a drunken friend round to knock on the door._ Is that\\nnecessary?\"\\n\\n\"Not strictly, but it is advisable to put it in. A great deal depends on\\npsychological impression. Judges in their more lucid moments sometimes\\nwonder why perfectly respectable, happily married men go off for\\nweek-ends to the seaside with women they do not know. It is always\\nhelpful to offer evidence of general degeneracy.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Brenda. \"_From then onwards I had him watched by private\\nagents and as a result of what they told me, I left my husband\\'s house\\non April 5th._ Yes, that all seems quite clear.\"\\n\\n[III]\\n\\nLady St Cloud preserved an atavistic faith in the authority and\\npreternatural good judgment of the Head of the Family; accordingly, her\\nfirst act, on learning from Marjorie of Brenda\\'s wayward behaviour, was\\nto cable for Reggie\\'s return from Tunisia where he was occupied in\\ndesecrating some tombs. His departure, like all his movements, was\\nleisurely. He did not take the first available boat or the second, but\\neventually he arrived in London on the Monday after Tony\\'s visit to\\nBrighton. He held a family conclave in his library, consisting of his\\nmother, Brenda, Marjorie, Allan and the solicitor; later he discussed\\nthe question fully with each of them severally; he took Beaver out to\\nluncheon; he dined with Jock; he even called on Tony\\'s Aunt Frances.\\nFinally, on Thursday evening he arranged to meet Tony for dinner at\\nBrown\\'s.\\n\\nHe was eight years older than Brenda; very occasionally a fugitive,\\nindefinable likeness was detectable between him and Marjorie, but both\\nin character and appearance he was as different from Brenda as it was\\npossible to imagine. He was prematurely, unnaturally stout, and he\\ncarried his burden of flesh as though he were not yet used to it; as\\nthough it had been buckled on to him that morning for the first time and\\nhe were still experimenting for its better adjustment; there was an\\ninstability in his gait and in his eyes a furtive look as though he were\\nat any moment liable to ambush and realized that he was unfairly\\nhandicapped for flight. This impression, however, was due solely to his\\nphysical appearance; it was the deep bed of fat in which his eyes lay\\nthat gave them this look of suspicion; the caution of his movements\\nresulted from the exertion of keeping his balance and not from any\\nembarrassment at his own clumsiness, for it had never occurred to him\\nthat he looked at all unusual.\\n\\nRather more than half Reggie St Cloud\\'s time and income was spent abroad\\nin modest archaeological expeditions. His house in London was full of\\ntheir fruit--fragmentary amphoras, corroded bronze axe heads, little\\nsplinters of bone and charred stick, a Graeco-Roman head in marble, its\\nfeatures obliterated and ground smooth with time. He had written two\\nlittle monographs about his work, privately printed and both dedicated\\nto members of the royal family. When he came to London he was regular in\\nattendance at the House of Lords; all his friends were well over forty\\nand for some years now he had established himself as a member of their\\ngeneration; few mothers still regarded him as a possible son-in-law.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"This whole business of Brenda is _very_ unfortunate,\" said Reggie St\\nCloud.\\n\\nTony agreed.\\n\\n\"My mother is extremely upset about it, naturally. I\\'m upset myself. I\\ndon\\'t mind admitting, perfectly frankly, that I think she has behaved\\nvery foolishly, foolishly and wrongly. I can quite understand your being\\nupset about it too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"But all the same, making every allowance for your feelings, I do think\\nthat you are behaving rather vindictively in the matter.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m doing exactly what Brenda wanted.\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow, she doesn\\'t know what she wants. I saw this chap Beaver\\nyesterday. I didn\\'t like him _at all_. Do you?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know him.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I can assure you I didn\\'t like him. Now you\\'re just throwing\\nBrenda into his arms. That\\'s what it amounts to, as I see it, and I call\\nit vindictive. Of course, at the moment Brenda\\'s got the idea that she\\'s\\nin love with him. But it won\\'t last. It couldn\\'t with a chap like\\nBeaver. She\\'ll want to come back in a year, just you see. Allan says the\\nsame.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told Allan. I don\\'t want her back.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s vindictive.\"\\n\\n\"No, I just couldn\\'t feel the same about her again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, why feel _the same_? One has to change as one gets older. Why,\\nten years ago I couldn\\'t be interested in anything later than the\\nSumerian age and I assure you that now I find even the Christian era\\nfull of significance.\"\\n\\nFor some time he spoke about some _tabulae exsecrationum_ that he had\\nlately unearthed. \"Almost every grave had them,\" he said, \"mostly\\nreferring to the circus factions, scratched on lead. They used to be\\ndropped in through a funnel. We had found forty-three up-to-date, before\\nthis wretched business happened, and I had to come back. Naturally I\\'m\\nupset.\"\\n\\nHe sat for a little, eating silently. This last observation had brought\\nthe conversation back to its point of departure. He clearly had more to\\nsay on the subject and was meditating the most convenient approach. He\\nate in a ruthless manner, champing his food (it was his habit, often,\\nwithout noticing it, to consume things that others usually left on their\\nplates, the heads and tails of whiting, whole mouthfuls of chicken bone,\\npeach stones and apple cores, cheese rinds and the fibrous parts of the\\nartichoke). \"Besides, you know,\" he said, \"it isn\\'t as though it was all\\nBrenda\\'s fault.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t been thinking particularly whose fault it is.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s all very well, but you seem rather to be taking the line\\nof the injured husband--saying you can\\'t feel the same again, and all\\nthat. I mean to say, it takes two to make a quarrel and I gather things\\nhad been going wrong for some time. For instance, you\\'d been drinking a\\nlot--have some more burgundy, by the way.\"\\n\\n\"Did Brenda say that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. And then you\\'d been going round a bit with other girls yourself.\\nThere was some woman with a Moorish name you had to stay at Hetton while\\nBrenda was there. Well, that\\'s a bit thick, you know. I\\'m all for people\\ngoing their own way, but if they do they can\\'t blame others, if you see\\nwhat I mean.\"\\n\\n\"Did Brenda say that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. Don\\'t think I\\'m trying to lecture you or anything, but all I feel\\nis that you haven\\'t any right to be vindictive to Brenda, as things\\nare.\"\\n\\n\"She said I drank and was having an affair with the woman with a Moorish\\nname?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know she actually said that, but she said you\\'d been\\ngetting tight lately and that you were certainly interested in that\\ngirl.\"\\n\\nThe fat young man opposite Tony ordered prunes and cream. Tony said he\\nhad finished dinner.\\n\\nHe had imagined during the preceding week-end that nothing could now\\nsurprise him.\\n\\n\"So that really explains what I want to say,\" continued Reggie blandly.\\n\"It\\'s about money. I understand that when Brenda was in a very agitated\\nstate just after the death of her child, she consented to some verbal\\narrangement with you about settlements.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m allowing her five hundred a year.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you know, I don\\'t think that you have any right to take advantage\\nof her generosity in that way. It was most imprudent of her to consider\\nyour proposal--she admits now that she was not really herself when she\\ndid so.\"\\n\\n\"What does she suggest instead?\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go outside and have coffee.\"\\n\\nWhen they were settled in front of the fire in the empty smoking-room,\\nhe answered, \"Well, I\\'ve discussed it with the lawyers and with the\\nfamily and we decided that the sum should be increased to two thousand.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s quite out of the question. I couldn\\'t begin to afford it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you know, I have to consider Brenda\\'s interests. She has very\\nlittle of her own and there will be no more coming to her. My mother\\'s\\nincome is an allowance which I pay under my father\\'s will. I shan\\'t be\\nable to give her anything. I am trying to raise everything I can for an\\nexpedition to one of the oases in the Libyan desert. This chap Beaver\\nhas got practically nothing and doesn\\'t look like earning any. So you\\nsee--\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear Reggie, you know as well as I do that it\\'s out of the\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s rather less than a third of your income.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but almost every penny goes straight back to the estate. Do you\\nrealize that Brenda and I together haven\\'t spent half that amount a year\\non our personal expenses? It\\'s all I can do to keep things going as it\\nis.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t expect you\\'d take this line, Tony. I think it\\'s extremely\\nunreasonable of you. After all, it\\'s absurd to pretend in these days\\nthat a single man can\\'t be perfectly comfortable on four thousand a\\nyear. It\\'s as much as I\\'ve ever had.\"\\n\\n\"It would mean giving up Hetton.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I gave up Brakeleigh, and I assure you, my dear fellow, I never\\nregret it. It was a nasty wrench at the time, of course, old association\\nand everything like that, but I can tell you this, that when the sale\\nwas finally through I felt a different man, free to go where I liked...\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t happen to want to go anywhere else except Hetton.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lot in what these Labour fellows say, you know. Big houses\\nare a thing of the past in England.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me, did Brenda realize when she agreed to this proposal that it\\nmeant my leaving Hetton?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it was mentioned, I think. I daresay you\\'ll find it quite easy to\\nsell to a school or something like that. I remember the agent said when\\nI was trying to get rid of Brakeleigh that it was a pity it wasn\\'t\\nGothic, because schools and convents always go for Gothic. I daresay\\nyou\\'ll get a very comfortable price and find yourself better off in the\\nend than you are now.\"\\n\\n\"No. It\\'s impossible,\" said Tony.\\n\\n\"You\\'re making things extremely awkward for everyone,\" said Reggie. \"I\\ncan\\'t understand why you are taking up this attitude.\"\\n\\n\"What is more, I don\\'t believe that Brenda ever expected or wanted me to\\nagree.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, she did, my dear fellow. I assure you of that.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s inconceivable.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Reggie, puffing at his cigar, \"there\\'s more to it than just\\nmoney. Perhaps I\\'d better tell you everything. I hadn\\'t meant to. The\\ntruth is that Beaver is cutting up nasty. He says he can\\'t marry Brenda\\nunless she\\'s properly provided for. Not fair on her, he says. I quite\\nsee his point in a way.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I see his point,\" said Tony. \"So what your proposal really amounts\\nto, is that I should give up Hetton in order to buy Beaver for Brenda.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not how I should have put it,\" said Reggie.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not going to and that\\'s the end of it. If that\\'s all you\\nwanted to say, I may as well leave you.\"\\n\\n\"No, it isn\\'t quite all I wanted to say. In fact I think I must have put\\nthings rather badly. It comes from trying to respect people\\'s feelings\\ntoo much. You see, I wasn\\'t so much asking you to agree to anything as\\nexplaining what our side propose to do. I\\'ve tried to keep everything on\\na friendly basis but I see it\\'s not possible. Brenda will ask for\\nalimony of two thousand a year from the Court and on our evidence we\\nshall get it. I\\'m sorry you oblige me to put it so bluntly.\"\\n\\n\"I hadn\\'t thought of that.\"\\n\\n\"No, nor had we, to be quite frank. It was Beaver\\'s idea.\"\\n\\n\"You seem to have got me in a fairly hopeless position.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not how I should have put it.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to make absolutely sure that Brenda is in on this. D\\'you\\nmind if I ring her up?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all, my dear fellow. I happen to know she\\'s at Marjorie\\'s\\nto-night.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Brenda, this is Tony... I\\'ve just been dining with Reggie.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he said something about it.\"\\n\\n\"He tells me that you are going to sue for alimony. Is that so?\"\\n\\n\"Tony, don\\'t be so bullying. The lawyers are doing everything. It\\'s no\\nuse coming to me.\"\\n\\n\"But did you know that they proposed to ask for two thousand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. They did say that. I know it sounds a lot but...\"\\n\\n\"And you know exactly how my money stands, don\\'t you? You know it means\\nselling Hetton, don\\'t you?... hullo, are you still there?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m here.\"\\n\\n\"You know it means that?\"\\n\\n\"Tony, don\\'t make me feel a beast. Everything has been so difficult.\"\\n\\n\"You do know just what you are asking?\"\\n\\n\"Yes... I suppose so.\"\\n\\n\"All right, that\\'s all I wanted to know.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, how odd you sound... don\\'t ring off.\"\\n\\nHe hung up the receiver and went back to the smoking-room. His mind had\\nsuddenly become clearer on many points that had puzzled him. A whole\\nGothic world had come to grief... there was now no armour glittering\\nthrough the forest glades, no embroidered feet on the green sward; the\\ncream and dappled unicorns had fled...\\n\\nReggie sat expanded in his chair. \"Well?\"\\n\\n\"I got on to her. You were quite right. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t believe you.\\nIt seemed so unlikely at first.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, my dear fellow.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve decided exactly what\\'s going to happen.\"\\n\\n\"Good.\"\\n\\n\"Brenda is not going to get her divorce. The evidence I provided at\\nBrighton isn\\'t worth anything. There happens to have been a child there\\nall the time. She slept both nights in the room I am supposed to have\\noccupied. If you care to bring the case I shall defend it and win, but I\\nthink when you have seen my evidence you will drop it. I am going away\\nfor six months or so. When I come back, if she wishes it, I shall\\ndivorce Brenda without settlements of any kind. Is that clear?\"\\n\\n\"But look here, my dear fellow.\"\\n\\n\"Good night. Thank you for the dinner. Good luck to the excavations.\"\\n\\nOn his way out of the club he noticed that John Beaver of Bratt\\'s Club\\nwas up for election.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Who on earth would have expected the old boy to turn up like that?\"\\nasked Polly Cockpurse.\\n\\n\"Now I understand why they keep going on in the papers about divorce law\\nreform,\" said Veronica. \"It\\'s _too_ monstrous that he should be allowed\\nto get away with it.\"\\n\\n\"The mistake they made was in telling him first,\" said Souki.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so like Brenda to trust everyone,\" said Jenny Abdul Akbar.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"I do think Tony comes out of this pretty poorly,\" said Marjorie.\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" said Allan. \"I expect your ass of a brother put the\\nthing wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\nIN SEARCH OF A CITY\\n\\n\\n[I]\\n\\n\"any idea how many times round the deck make a mile?\"\\n\\n\"None, I\\'m afraid,\" said Tony. \"But I should think you must have walked\\na great distance.\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-two times. One soon gets out of sorts at sea if you\\'re used to\\nan active life. She\\'s not much of a boat. Travel with this line often?\"\\n\\n\"Never before.\"\\n\\n\"Ah. Thought you might have been in business in the islands. Not many\\ntourists going out this time of year. Just the other way about. All\\ncoming home, if you see what I mean. Going far?\"\\n\\n\"Demerara.\"\\n\\n\"Ah. Looking for minerals perhaps?\"\\n\\n\"No, to tell you the truth I am looking for a city.\"\\n\\nThe genial passenger was surprised and then laughed. \"Sounded just like\\nyou said you were looking for a city.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That _was_ what you said?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I thought it sounded like that... well, so long. I must do another few\\nrounds before dinner.\"\\n\\nHe paced off up the deck, straddling slightly in order to keep his\\nbalance and occasionally putting out a hand to the rail for support.\\n\\nRegularly every three minutes for the last hour or so, this man had come\\nby. At first Tony had looked up at his approach and then turned away\\nagain, out to sea. Presently the man had taken to nodding, then to\\nsaying \"Hullo\" or \"Bit choppy\" or \"Here we are again\"; finally he had\\nstopped and began a conversation.\\n\\nTony went aft to break this rather embarrassing sequence. He descended\\nthe companion way which led to the lower deck. Here, in crates lashed to\\nthe side, was a variety of livestock--some stud bulls, a heavily\\nblanketed racehorse, a couple of beagles, being exported to various West\\nIndian islands. Tony threaded a way between them and the hatches to the\\nstern, where he sat against a winch watching the horizon mount above the\\nfunnels, then fall until they stood out black against the darkening sky.\\nThe pitch was more sensible here than it had been amidships; the animals\\nshifted restlessly in their cramped quarters; the beagles whined\\nintermittently. A lascar took down from a line some washing which had\\nbeen flapping there all day.\\n\\nThe wash of the ship was quickly lost in the high waves. They were\\nsteaming westward down the Channel. As it grew to be night, lighthouses\\nappeared flashing from the French coast. Presently a steward walked\\nround the bright, upper deck striking chimes on a gong of brass\\ncylinders, and the genial passenger went below to prepare himself for\\ndinner in hot sea water which splashed from side to side of the bath and\\ndissolved the soap in a thin, sticky scum. He was the only man to dress\\nthat evening: Tony sat in the mustering darkness until the second bell.\\nThen he left his greatcoat in the cabin and went down to dinner.\\n\\nIt was the first evening at sea.\\n\\nTony sat at the captain\\'s table, but the captain was on the bridge.\\nThere were empty chairs on either side of him. It was not rough enough\\nfor the fiddles to be out, but the stewards had removed the flower vases\\nand damped the tablecloth to make it adhesive. A coloured archdeacon sat\\nfacing him. He ate with great refinement but his black hands looked\\nimmense on the wet, whitish cloth. \"I\\'m afraid our table is not showing\\nup very well to-night,\" he said. \"I see you are not a sufferer. My wife\\nis in her cabin. _She_ is a sufferer.\"\\n\\nHe was returning from a Congress, he told Tony.\\n\\nAt the top of the stairs was a lounge named the Music and Writing Room.\\nThe light here was always subdued, in the day by the stained glass of\\nthe windows, at night by pink silk shades which hid the electric\\ncandles. Here the passengers assembled for their coffee, sitting on\\nbulky, tapestry-covered chesterfields or on swivel chairs irremovably\\nfastened before the writing tables. Here too the steward for an hour\\nevery day presided over the cupboardful of novels which constituted the\\nship\\'s library.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not much of a boat,\" said the genial passenger, sitting himself\\nbeside Tony. \"But I expect things will look brighter when we get into\\nthe sun.\"\\n\\nTony lit a cigar and was told by a steward that he must not smoke in\\nthis room. \"That\\'s all right,\" said the genial passenger, \"we\\'re just\\ngoing down to the bar. You know,\" he said a few minutes later, \"I feel I\\nowe you an apology. I thought you were potty just now before dinner.\\nHonestly I did, when you said you were going to Demerara to look for a\\ncity. Well, it sounded pretty potty. Then the purser--I\\'m at his table.\\nAlways get the cheeriest crowd at the purser\\'s table _and_ the best\\nattention--the purser told me about you. You\\'re the explorer, aren\\'t\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, come to think of it, I suppose I am,\" said Tony.\\n\\nIt did not come easily to him to realize that he was an explorer. It was\\nbarely a fortnight ago that he had become one. Even the presence in the\\nhold of two vast crates, bearing his name and labelled _NOT WANTED ON\\nTHE VOYAGE_--crates containing such new and unfamiliar possessions as a\\nmedicine chest, an automatic shot-gun, camping equipment, pack saddles,\\na cinema camera, dynamite, disinfectants, a collapsible canoe, filters,\\ntinned butter and, strangest of all, an assortment of what Dr Messinger\\ncalled \"trade goods\"--failed to convince him fully of the serious nature\\nof his expedition. Dr Messinger had arranged everything. It was he who\\nchose the musical boxes and mechanical mice, the mirrors, combs,\\nperfumery, pills, fish hooks, axe heads, coloured rockets and rolls of\\nartificial silk, which were packed in the box of \"trade goods\". And Dr\\nMessinger himself was a new acquaintance who, prostrate now in his bunk\\nwith what the Negro clergyman would have called \"suffering\", that day,\\nfor the first time since Tony had met him, seemed entirely human.\\n\\nTony had spent very little of his life abroad. At the age of eighteen,\\nbefore going to the University, he had been boarded for the summer with\\nan elderly gentleman near Tours, with the intention that he should learn\\nthe language. (...a grey stone house surrounded by vines. There was a\\nstuffed spaniel in the bathroom. The old man had called it \"Stop\"\\nbecause it was chic at that time to give dogs an English name. Tony had\\nbicycled along straight, white roads to visit the chateaux; he carried\\nrolls of bread and cold veal tied to the back of the machine, and the\\nsoft dust seeped into them through the paper and gritted against his\\nteeth. There were two other English boys there, so he had learned little\\nFrench. One of them fell in love and the other got drunk for the first\\ntime on sparkling Vouvray at a fair that had been held in the town. That\\nevening Tony won a live pigeon at a tombola; he set it free and later\\nsaw it being recaptured by the proprietor of the stall with a butterfly\\nnet...) Later he had gone to Central Europe for a few weeks with a\\nfriend from Balliol. (They had found themselves suddenly rich with the\\nfalling mark and had lived in unaccustomed grandeur in the largest hotel\\nsuites. Tony had bought a fur for a few shillings and given it to a girl\\nin Munich who spoke no English.) Later still his honeymoon with Brenda\\nin a villa, lent to them, on the Italian Riviera. (...Cypress and olive\\ntrees, a domed church half-way down the hill, between the villa and the\\nharbour, a caf? where they sat out in the evening, watching the\\nfishing-boats and the lights reflected in the quiet water, waiting for\\nthe sudden agitation of sound and motion as the speed-boat came in. It\\nhad been owned by a dashing young official, who called it _Jazz Girl_.\\nHe seemed to spend twenty hours a day running in and out of the little\\nharbour...) Once Brenda and he had gone to Le Touquet with Bratt\\'s golf\\nteam. That was all. After his father died he had not left England. They\\ncould not easily afford it; it was one of the things they postponed\\nuntil death duties were paid off; besides that, he was never happy away\\nfrom Hetton, and Brenda did not like leaving John Andrew.\\n\\nThus Tony had no very ambitious ideas about travel, and when he decided\\nto go abroad his first act was to call at a tourist agency and come away\\nladen with a sheaf of brightly coloured prospectuses, which advertised\\ncommodious cruises among palm trees, Negresses and ruined arches. He was\\ngoing away because it seemed to be the conduct expected of a husband in\\nhis circumstances, because the associations of Hetton were for the time\\npoisoned for him, because he wanted to live for a few months away from\\npeople who would know him or Brenda, in places where there was no\\nexpectation of meeting her or Beaver or Reggie St Cloud at every corner\\nhe frequented, and, with this feeling of evasion dominant in his mind,\\nhe took the prospectuses to read at the Greville Club. He had been a\\nmember there for some years, but rarely used it; his resignation was\\npostponed only by his recurrent omission to cancel the banker\\'s order\\nfor his subscription. Now that Bratt\\'s and Brown\\'s were distasteful to\\nhim he felt thankful that he had kept on with the Greville. It was a\\nclub of intellectual flavour, composed of dons, a few writers and the\\nofficials of museums and learned societies. It had a tradition of\\ngarrulity, so that he was not surprised when, seated in an armchair and\\nsurrounded with his illustrated folders, he was addressed by a member\\nunknown to him who asked if he were thinking of going away. He was more\\nsurprised when he looked up and studied the questioner.\\n\\nDr Messinger, though quite young, was bearded, and Tony knew few young\\nmen with beards. He was also very small, very sunburned and prematurely\\nbald; the ruddy brown of his face ended abruptly along the line of his\\nforehead, which rose in a pale dome; he wore steel-rimmed spectacles and\\nthere was something about his blue serge suit which suggested that the\\nwearer found it uncomfortable.\\n\\nTony admitted that he was considering taking a cruise.\\n\\n\"I am going away shortly,\" said Dr Messinger, \"to Brazil. At least it\\nmay be Brazil or Dutch Guiana. One cannot tell. The frontier has never\\nbeen demarcated. I ought to have started last week, only my plans were\\nupset. Do you by any chance know a Nicaraguan calling himself\\nalternately Ponsonby and FitzClarence?\"\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t think I do.\"\\n\\n\"You are fortunate. That man has just robbed me of two hundred pounds\\nand some machine guns.\"\\n\\n\"Machine guns?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I travel with one or two, mostly for show, you know, or for trade,\\nand they are not easy to buy nowadays. Have you ever tried?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Well you can take it from me that it\\'s not easy. You can\\'t just walk\\ninto a shop and order machine guns.\"\\n\\n\"No, I suppose not.\"\\n\\n\"Still, at a pinch I can do without them. But I can\\'t do without two\\nhundred pounds.\"\\n\\nTony had, open on his knee, a photograph of the harbour at Agadir. Dr\\nMessinger looked over his shoulder at it. \"Ah yes,\" he said,\\n\"interesting little place. I expect you know Zingermaun there?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ve not been there yet.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d like him--a very straight fellow. He used to do quite a lot,\\nselling ammunition to the Atlas caids before the pacification. Of course\\nit was easy money with the capitulations, but he did it better than most\\nof them. I believe he\\'s running a restaurant now in Mogador.\" Then he\\ncontinued dreamily, \"The pity is I can\\'t let the R.G.S. in on this\\nexpedition. I\\'ve got to find the money privately.\"\\n\\nIt was one o\\'clock and the room was beginning to fill up; an\\nEgyptologist was exhibiting a handkerchief-ful of scarabs to the editor\\nof a church weekly.\\n\\n\"We\\'d better go up and lunch,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\nTony had not intended to lunch at the Greville but there was something\\ncompelling about the invitation; moreover, he had no other engagement.\\n\\nDr Messinger lunched off apples and a rice pudding. (\"I have to be very\\ncareful what I eat,\" he said.) Tony ate cold steak and kidney pie. They\\nsat at a window in the big dining-room upstairs. The places round them\\nwere soon filled with members, who even carried the tradition of general\\nconversation so far as to lean back in their chairs and chat over their\\nshoulders from table to table--a practice which greatly hindered the\\nalready imperfect service. But Tony remained oblivious to all that was\\nsaid, absorbed in what Dr Messinger was telling him.\\n\\n\"...You see, there has been a continuous tradition about the City since\\nthe first explorers of the sixteenth century. It has been variously\\nallocated, sometimes down in Matto Grosso, sometimes on the upper\\nOrinoco in what is now Venezuela. I myself used to think it lay\\nsomewhere on the Uraricuera. I was out there last year and it was then\\nthat I established contact with the Pie-wie Indians; no white man had\\never visited them and got out alive. And it was from the Pie-wies that I\\nlearned where to look. None of them had ever visited the City, of\\ncourse, but they _knew about it_. Every Indian between Ciudad Bolivar\\nand Para knows about it. But they won\\'t talk. Queer people. But I became\\nblood-brother with a Pie-wie--interesting ceremony. They buried me up to\\nthe neck in mud and all the women of the tribe spat on my head. Then we\\nate a toad and snake and a beetle and after that I was\\nblood-brother--well, he told me that the City lies between the head\\nwaters of the Courantyne and the Takutu. There\\'s a vast track of\\nunexplored country there. I\\'ve often thought of visiting it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been looking up the historical side too, and I more or less know\\nhow the City got there. It was the result of a migration from Peru at\\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century, when the Incas were at the\\nheight of their power. It is mentioned in all the early Spanish\\ndocuments as a popular legend. One of the younger princes rebelled and\\nled his people off into the forest. Most of the tribes had a tradition\\nin one form or another of a strange race passing through their\\nterritory.\"\\n\\n\"But what do you suppose this city will be like?\"\\n\\n\"Impossible to say. Every tribe has a different word for it. The\\nPie-wies call it the \\'Shining\\' or \\'Glittering\\', the Arekuna the \\'Many\\nWatered\\', the Patamonas the \\'Bright Feathered\\', the Warau, oddly enough,\\nuse the same word for it that they use for a kind of aromatic jam they\\nmake. Of course, one can\\'t tell how a civilization may have developed or\\ndegenerated in five hundred years of isolation...\"\\n\\nBefore Tony left the Greville that day, he tore up his sheaf of cruise\\nprospectuses, for he had arranged to join Dr Messinger in his\\nexpedition.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"Done much of that kind of thing?\"\\n\\n\"No, to tell you the truth it is the first time.\"\\n\\n\"Ah. Well, I daresay it\\'s more interesting than it sounds,\" conceded the\\ngenial passenger, \"else people wouldn\\'t do it so much.\"\\n\\nThe ship, so far as any consideration of comfort had contributed to her\\ndesign, was planned for the tropics. It was slightly colder in the\\nsmoking-room than on deck. Tony went to his cabin and retrieved his cap\\nand greatcoat; then he went aft again, to the place where he had sat\\nbefore dinner. It was a starless night and nothing was visible beyond\\nthe small luminous area round the ship, save for a single lighthouse\\nthat flashed short-long, short-long, far away on the port bow. The\\ncrests of the waves caught the reflection from the promenade deck and\\nshone for a moment before plunging away into the black depths behind.\\nThe beagles were awake, whining.\\n\\nFor some days now Tony had been thoughtless about the events of the\\nimmediate past. His mind was occupied with the City, the Shining, the\\nMany Watered, the Bright Feathered, the Aromatic Jam. He had a clear\\npicture of it in his mind. It was Gothic in character, all vanes and\\npinnacles, gargoyles, battlements, groining and tracery, pavilions and\\nterraces, a transfigured Hetton, pennons and banners floating on the\\nsweet breeze, everything luminous and translucent; a coral citadel\\ncrowning a green hill-top sown with daisies, among groves and streams; a\\ntapestry landscape filled with heraldic and fabulous animals and\\nsymmetrical, disproportionate blossom.\\n\\nThe ship tossed and tunnelled through the dark waters towards this\\nradiant sanctuary.\\n\\n\"I wonder if anyone is doing anything about those dogs,\" said the genial\\npassenger, arriving at his elbow. \"I\\'ll ask the purser to-morrow. We\\nmight exercise them a bit. Kind of mournful the way they go on.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nNext day they were in the Atlantic. Ponderous waves rising over murky,\\nopaque depths. Dappled with foam at the crests, like downland, where on\\nthe high, exposed places snow has survived the thaw. Lead-grey and slate\\nin the sun, olive, field blue and khaki like the uniforms of a\\nbattlefield; the sky overhead was neutral and steely with swollen clouds\\nscudding across it, affording rare half-hours of sunlight. The masts\\nswung slowly across this sky and the bows heaved and wallowed below the\\nhorizon. The man who had made friends with Tony paraded the deck with\\nthe two beagles. They strained at the end of their chains, sniffing the\\nscuppers; the man lurched behind them unsteadily. He wore a pair of race\\nglasses with which he occasionally surveyed the seas; he offered them to\\nTony whenever they passed each other.\\n\\n\"Been talking to the wireless operator,\" he said. \"We ought to pass\\nquite near the Yarmouth Castle at about eleven.\"\\n\\nFew of the passengers were on their feet. Those who had come on deck lay\\nin long chairs on the sheltered side, pensive, wrapped in tartan rugs.\\nDr Messinger kept to his cabin. Tony went to see him and found him\\ntorpid, for he was taking large doses of chloral. Towards evening the\\nwind freshened and by dinner-time was blowing hard; portholes were\\nscrewed up and all destructible objects disposed on the cabin floors; a\\nsudden roll broke a dozen coffee cups in the music and reading room.\\nThat night there was little sleep for anyone on board; the plating\\ncreaked, luggage shifted from wall to wall. Tony wedged himself firm in\\nhis bunk with the lifebelt and thought of the City.\\n\\n...Carpet and canopy, tapestry and velvet, portcullis and bastion,\\nwaterfowl on the moat and kingcups along its margin, peacocks trailing\\ntheir finery across the lawns; high overhead in a sky of sapphire and\\nswansdown silver bells chiming in a turret of alabaster.\\n\\nDays of shadow and exhaustion, salt wind and wet mist, foghorn and the\\nconstant groan and creak of straining metal. Then they were clear of it,\\nafter the Azores. Awnings were out and passengers moved their chairs to\\nwindward. High noon and an even keel; the blue water lapping against the\\nsides of the ship, rippling away behind her to the horizon; gramophones\\nand deck tennis; bright arcs of flying fish (\"Look, Ernie, come quick,\\nthere\\'s a shark.\" \"That\\'s not a shark, it\\'s a dolphin.\" \"Mr Brink said\\nit was a porpoise.\" \"There he is again. Oh, if I had my camera.\");\\nclear, tranquil water and the regular turn and tread of the screw; there\\nwere many hands to caress the beagles as they went loping by. Mr Brink\\namid laughter suggested that he should exercise the racehorse, or, with\\na further burst of invention, the bull. Mr Brink sat at the purser\\'s\\ntable with the cheery crowd.\\n\\nDr Messinger left his cabin and appeared on deck and in the\\ndining-saloon. So did the wife of the archdeacon; she was very much\\nwhiter than her husband. On Tony\\'s other side at table sat a girl named\\nTh?r?se de Vitr?. He had noticed her once or twice during the grey days,\\na forlorn figure almost lost among furs and cushions and rugs; a\\ncolourless little face with wide dark eyes. She said, \"The last days\\nhave been terrible. I saw you walking about. How I envied you.\"\\n\\n\"It ought to be calm all the way now,\" and inevitably, \"Are you going\\nfar?\"\\n\\n\"Trinidad. That is my home... I tried to decide who you were from the\\npassenger list.\"\\n\\n\"Who was I?\"\\n\\n\"Well... someone called Colonel Strapper.\"\\n\\n\"Do I look so old?\"\\n\\n\"Are colonels old? I didn\\'t know. It\\'s not a thing we have much in\\nTrinidad. Now I know who you are because I asked the head steward. Do\\ntell me about your exploring.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d better ask Doctor Messinger. He knows more about it than I do.\"\\n\\n\"No, _you_ tell me.\"\\n\\nShe was eighteen years old; small and dark, with a face that disappeared\\nin a soft pointed chin so that attention was drawn to the grave eyes and\\nthe high forehead; she had not long outgrown her schoolgirl plumpness\\nand she moved with an air of exultance, as though she had lately shed an\\nencumbrance and was not yet fatigued by the other burdens that would\\nsucceed it. For two years she had been at school in Paris.\\n\\n\"...Some of us used to keep lipstick and rouge secretly in our bedrooms\\nand try it on at night. One girl called Antoinette came to Mass on\\nSunday wearing it. There was a terrible row with Madame de Supplice and\\nshe left after that term. It was awfully brave. We all envied her...\\nBut she was an ugly girl, always eating chocolates...\"\\n\\n\"...Now I am coming home to be married... No, I am not yet engaged,\\nbut you see there are so few young men I can marry. They must be\\nCatholic and of an island family. It would not do to marry an official\\nand go back to live in England. But it will be easy because I have no\\nbrothers or sisters and my father has one of the best houses in\\nTrinidad. You must come and see it. It is a stone house, outside the\\ntown. My family came to Trinidad in the French Revolution. There are two\\nor three other rich families and I shall marry into one of them. Our son\\nwill have the house. It will be easy...\"\\n\\nShe wore a little coat, of the kind that was then fashionable, and no\\nornament except a string of pearls. \"...There was an American girl at\\nMadame de Supplice\\'s who was engaged. She had a ring with a big diamond\\nbut she could never wear it except in bed. Then one day she had a letter\\nfrom her young man saying he was going to marry another girl. How she\\ncried. We all read the letter and most of us cried too... But in\\nTrinidad it will be quite easy.\"\\n\\nTony told her about the expedition; of the Peruvian emigrants in the\\nmiddle ages and their long caravan working through the mountains and\\nforests, llamas packed with works of intricate craftsmanship; of the\\ncontinual rumours percolating to the coast and luring adventurers up\\ninto the forests; of the route they would take up the rivers, then\\ncutting through the bush along Indian trails and across untravelled\\ncountry; of the stream they might strike higher up and how, Dr Messinger\\nsaid, they would make woodskin canoes and take to the water again; how\\nfinally they would arrive under the walls of the city like the Vikings\\nat Byzantium. \"But of course,\" he added, \"there may be nothing in it. It\\nought to be an interesting journey in any case.\"\\n\\n\"How I wish I was a man,\" said Th?r?se de Vitr?.\\n\\nAfter dinner they danced to the music of an amplified gramophone and the\\ngirl drank lemon squash on the bench outside the deck bar, sucking it\\nthrough two straws.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nA week of blue water that grew clearer and more tranquil daily, of sun\\nthat grew warmer, radiating the ship and her passengers, filling them\\nwith good humour and ease; blue water that caught the sun in a thousand\\nbrilliant points, dazzling the eyes as they searched for porpoises and\\nflying fish; clear blue water in the shallows revealing its bed of\\nsilver sand and smooth pebble, fathoms down; soft warm shade on deck\\nunder the awnings; the ship moved amid unbroken horizons on a vast blue\\ndisc of blue, sparkling with sunlight.\\n\\nTony and Miss de Vitr? played quoits and shuffle-board; they threw rope\\nrings into a bucket from a short distance. (\"We\\'ll go in a small boat,\"\\nDr Messinger had said, \"so as to escape all that hideous nonsense of\\ndeck games.\") Twice consecutively Tony won the sweepstake on the ship\\'s\\nrun; the prize was eighteen shillings. He bought Miss de Vitr? a woollen\\nrabbit at the barber\\'s shop.\\n\\nIt was unusual for Tony to use \"Miss\" in talking to anyone. Except Miss\\nTendril, he could think of no one he addressed in that way. But it was\\nTh?r?se who first called him \"Tony\", seeing it engraved in Brenda\\'s\\nhandwriting in his cigarette case. \"How funny,\" she said, \"that was the\\nname of the man who didn\\'t marry the American girl at Madame de\\nSupplice\\'s\"; and after that they used each other\\'s Christian names, to\\nthe great satisfaction of the other passengers, who had little to\\ninterest them on board except the flowering of this romance.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t believe this is the same ship as in those cold, rough days,\"\\nsaid Th?r?se.\\n\\nThey reached the first of the islands; a green belt of palm trees with\\nwooded hills rising beyond them and a small town heaped up along the\\nshores of a bay. Th?r?se and Tony went ashore and bathed. Th?r?se swam\\nbadly, with her head ridiculously erect out of the water. There was\\npractically no bathing in Trinidad, she explained. They lay for some\\ntime on the firm, silver beach; then drove back into the town in the\\nshaky, two-horse carriage he had hired, past ramshackle cabins from\\nwhich little black boys ran out to beg or swing behind on the axle, in\\nthe white dust. There was nowhere in the town to dine so they returned\\nto the ship at sundown. She lay out at some distance, but from where\\nthey stood after dinner, leaning over the rail, they could just hear, in\\nthe intervals when the winch was not working, the chatter and singing in\\nthe streets. Th?r?se put her arm through Tony\\'s, but the decks were full\\nof passengers and agents and swarthy little men with lists of cargo.\\nThere was no dancing that night. They went above on to the boat deck and\\nTony kissed her.\\n\\nDr Messinger came on board by the last launch. He had met an\\nacquaintance in the town. He had observed the growing friendship between\\nTony and Th?r?se with the strongest disapproval and told him of a friend\\nof his who had been knifed in a back street of Smyrna, as a warning of\\nwhat happened if one got mixed up with women.\\n\\nIn the islands the life of the ship disintegrated. There were changes of\\npassengers; the black archdeacon left after shaking hands with everyone\\non board; on their last morning his wife took round a collecting box in\\naid of an organ that needed repairs. The captain never appeared at meals\\nin the dining-saloon. Even Tony\\'s first friend no longer changed for\\ndinner; the cabins were stuffy from being kept locked all day.\\n\\nTony and Th?r?se bathed again at Barbados and drove round the island\\nvisiting castellated churches. They dined at an hotel high up out of\\ntown and ate flying fish.\\n\\n\"You must come to my home and see what real creole cooking is like,\"\\nsaid Th?r?se. \"We have a lot of old recipes that the planters used to\\nuse. You must meet my father and mother.\"\\n\\nThey could see the lights of the ship from the terrace where they were\\ndining; the bright decks with figures moving about and the double line\\nof portholes.\\n\\n\"Trinidad the day after to-morrow,\" said Tony.\\n\\nThey talked of the expedition and she said it was sure to be dangerous.\\n\"I don\\'t like Doctor Messinger at all,\" she said. \"Not anything about\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"And you will have to choose your husband.\"\\n\\n\"Yes. There are seven of them. There was one called Honor? I liked, but\\nof course I haven\\'t seen him for two years. He was studying to be an\\nengineer. There\\'s one called Mendoza who\\'s very rich but he isn\\'t really\\na Trinidadian. His grandfather came from Dominica and they say he has\\ncoloured blood. I expect it will be Honor?. Mother always brought in his\\nname when she wrote to me and he sent me things at Christmas and on my\\nf?te. Rather silly things, because the shops aren\\'t good in Port of\\nSpain.\"\\n\\nLater she said, \"You\\'ll be coming back by Trinidad, won\\'t you? So I\\nshall see you then. Will you be a long time in the bush?\"\\n\\n\"I expect you\\'ll be married by then.\"\\n\\n\"Tony, why haven\\'t you ever got married?\"\\n\\n\"But I am.\"\\n\\n\"Married?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re teasing me.\"\\n\\n\"No, honestly I am. At least I was.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"Are you surprised?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. Somehow I didn\\'t think you were. Where is she?\"\\n\\n\"In England. We had a row.\"\\n\\n\"Oh... What\\'s the time?\"\\n\\n\"Quite early.\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go back.\"\\n\\n\"D\\'you want to?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, please. It\\'s been a delightful day.\"\\n\\n\"You said that as if you were saying good-bye.\"\\n\\n\"Did I? I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nThe Negro chauffeur drove them at great speed into the town. Then they\\nsat in a rowing-boat and bobbed slowly out to the ship. Earlier in the\\nday, in good spirits, they had bought a stuffed fish. Th?r?se found she\\nhad left it behind at the hotel. \"It doesn\\'t matter,\" she said.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBlue water came to an end after Barbados. Round Trinidad the sea was\\nopaque and colourless, full of the mud which the Orinoco brought down\\nfrom the mainland. Th?r?se spent all that day in her cabin, doing her\\npacking.\\n\\nNext day she said good-bye to Tony in a hurry. Her father had come out\\nto meet her in the tender. He was a wiry bronzed man with a long grey\\nmoustache. He wore a panama hat and smart silk clothes, and smoked a\\ncheroot; the complete slave-owner of the last century. Th?r?se did not\\nintroduce him to Tony. \"He was someone on the ship,\" she explained,\\nobviously.\\n\\nTony saw her once next day in the town, driving with a lady who was\\nobviously her mother. She waved but did not stop. \"Reserved lot, these\\nreal old creoles,\" remarked the passenger who had first made friends\\nwith Tony and had now attached himself again. \"Poor as church mice most\\nof them, but stinking proud. Time and again I\\'ve palled up with them on\\nboard and when we got to port it\\'s been good-bye. Do they ever so much\\nas ask you to their houses? Not they.\"\\n\\nTony spent the two days with his first friend who had business\\nconnections in the place. On the second day it rained heavily and they\\ncould not leave the terrace of the hotel. Dr Messinger was engaged on\\nsome technical enquiries at the Agricultural Institute.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nMuddy sea between Trinidad and Georgetown; and the ship lightened of\\ncargo rolled heavily in the swell. Dr Messinger took to his cabin once\\nmore. Rain fell continuously and a slight mist enclosed them so that\\nthey seemed to move in a small puddle of brown water; the foghorn\\nsounded regularly through the rain. Scarcely a dozen passengers remained\\non board and Tony prowled disconsolately about the deserted decks or sat\\nalone in the music room, his mind straying back along the path he had\\nforbidden it, to the tall elm avenue at Hetton and the budding copses.\\n\\nNext day they arrived at the mouth of the Demerara. The customs sheds\\nwere heavy with the reek of sugar and loud with the buzzing of bees.\\nThere were lengthy formalities in disembarking their stores, Dr\\nMessinger saw to it while Tony lit a cigar and strayed out on to the\\nquay. Small shipping of all kinds lay round them; on the farther bank a\\nlow, green fringe of mangrove; behind, the tin roofs of the town were\\nvisible among feathery palm trees; everything steamed from the recent\\nrain. Black stevedores grunted rhythmically at their work; West Indians\\ntrotted busily to and fro with invoices and bills of lading. Presently\\nDr Messinger pronounced that everything was in order and that they could\\ngo into the town to their hotel.\\n\\n\\n[II]\\n\\nThe storm lantern stood on the ground between the two hammocks, which,\\nin their white sheaths of mosquito net, looked like the cocoons of\\ngigantic silkworms. It was eight o\\'clock, two hours after sundown; river\\nand forest were already deep in night. The howler monkeys were silent\\nbut tree-frogs near at hand set up a continuous, hoarse chorus; birds\\nwere awake, calling and whistling, and far in the depths about them came\\nthe occasional rending and reverberation of dead wood falling among the\\ntrees.\\n\\nThe six black boys who manned the boat squatted at a distance round\\ntheir fire. They had collected some cobs of maize, three days back in a\\npart of the bush, deserted now, choked and overrun with wild growth,\\nthat had once been a farm. (The rank second growth at that place had\\nbeen full of alien plants, fruit and cereals, all gross now, and\\nreverting to earlier type.) The boys were roasting their cobs in the\\nembers.\\n\\nFire and storm lantern together shed little light; enough only to\\nsuggest the dilapidated roof over their heads, the heap of stores,\\ndisembarked and overrun by ants and, beyond, the undergrowth that had\\ninvaded the clearing and the vast columns of tree-trunks that rose above\\nit, disappearing out of sight in the darkness.\\n\\nBats like blighted fruit hung in clusters from the thatch and great\\nspiders rode across it astride their shadows. This place had once been a\\nbalata station. It was the farthest point of commercial penetration from\\nthe coast. Dr Messinger marked it on his map with a triangle and named\\nit in red \"First Base Camp\".\\n\\nThe first stage of the journey was over. For ten days they had been\\nchugging upstream in a broad, shallow boat. Once or twice they had\\npassed rapids (there the outboard engine had been reinforced by paddles;\\nthe men strained in time to the captain\\'s count; the bo\\'sun stood in the\\nbows with a long pole warding off the rocks). They had camped at sundown\\non patches of sandbank or in clearings cut from the surrounding bush.\\nOnce or twice they came to a \"house\" left behind by balata bleeders or\\ngold washers.\\n\\nAll day Tony and Dr Messinger sprawled amidships among their stores,\\nunder an improvised canopy of palm thatch; sometimes in the hot hours of\\nthe early afternoon they fell asleep. They ate in the boat, out of tins,\\nand drank rum mixed with the water of the river, which was mahogany\\nbrown but quite clear. The nights seemed interminable to Tony; twelve\\nhours of darkness, noisier than a city square with the squealing and\\ncroaking and trumpeting of the bush denizens. Dr Messinger could tell\\nthe hours by the succession of sounds. It was not possible to read by\\nthe light of the storm lantern. Sleep was irregular and brief after the\\ndays of lassitude and torpor. There was little to talk about; everything\\nhad been said during the day, in the warm shade among the stores. Tony\\nlay awake, scratching.\\n\\nSince they had left Georgetown there had not been any part of his body\\nthat was ever wholly at ease. His face and neck were burned by the sun\\nreflected from the water; the skin was flaking off them so that he was\\nunable to shave. The stiff growth of beard pricked him between chin and\\nthroat. Every exposed part of his skin was bitten by cabouri fly. They\\nhad found a way into the buttonholes of his shirt and the laces of his\\nbreeches; mosquitoes had got him at the ankles when he changed into\\nslacks for the evening. He had picked up b?tes rouges in the bush and\\nthey were crawling and burrowing under his skin; the bitter oil which Dr\\nMessinger had given him as protection had set up a rash of its own\\nwherever he had applied it. Every evening after washing he had burned\\noff a few ticks with a cigarette-end but they had left irritable little\\nscars behind them; so had the djiggas which one of the black boys had\\ndug out from under his toenails and the horny skin on his heels and the\\nballs of his feet. A marabunta had left a painful swelling on his left\\nhand.\\n\\nAs Tony scratched, he shook the framework from which the hammocks hung.\\nDr Messinger turned over and said, \"Oh, for God\\'s sake.\" He tried not to\\nscratch; then he tried to scratch quietly; then in a frenzy he scratched\\nas hard as he could, breaking the skin in a dozen places. \"Oh, for God\\'s\\nsake,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\n\"Half-past eight,\" thought Tony. \"In London they are just beginning to\\ncollect for dinner.\" It was the time of year in London when there were\\nparties every night. (Once, when he was trying to get engaged to Brenda,\\nhe had gone to them all. If they had dined in different houses, he would\\nsearch the crowd for Brenda and hang about by the stairs waiting for her\\nto arrive. Later he would hang about to take her home. Lady St Cloud had\\ndone everything to make it easy for him. Later, after they were married,\\nin the two years they had spent in London before Tony\\'s father died,\\nthey had been to fewer parties, one or two a week at the most, except\\nfor one very gay month, when Brenda was well again after John Andrew\\'s\\nbirth.) Tony began to imagine a dinner party assembling at that moment\\nin London, with Brenda there and the surprised look with which she\\ngreeted each new arrival. If there was a fire she would be as near it as\\nshe could get. Would there be a fire at the end of May? He could not\\nremember. There were nearly always fires at Hetton in the evening,\\nwhatever the season.\\n\\nThen, after another bout of scratching, it occurred to Tony that it was\\nnot half-past eight in England. There was five hours\\' difference in\\ntime. They had altered their watches daily on the voyage out. Which way?\\nIt ought to be easy to work out. The sun rose in the east. England was\\neast of America so he and Dr Messinger got the sun later. It came to\\nthem at second-hand and slightly soiled after Polly Cockpurse and Mrs\\nBeaver and Princess Abdul Akbar had finished with it... Like Polly\\'s\\ndresses which Brenda used to buy for ten or fifteen pounds each... he\\nfell asleep.\\n\\nHe woke an hour later to hear Dr Messinger cursing, and to see him\\nsitting astride his hammock working with bandages and iodine at his\\ngreat toe.\\n\\n\"A vampire bat got it. I must have gone to sleep with my foot against\\nthe netting. God knows how long he had been at it, before I woke up.\\nThat lamp ought to keep them off but it doesn\\'t seem to.\"\\n\\nThe black boys were still awake, munching over the fire. \"Vampires\\nplenty bad this side, Chief,\" they said. \"Dat for why us no leave de\\nfire.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s just the way to get sick, blast it,\" said Dr Messinger. \"I may\\nhave lost pints of blood.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda and Jock were dancing together at Anchorage House. It was late,\\nthe party was thinning, and now, for the first time that evening, it was\\npossible to dance with pleasure. The ballroom was hung with tapestry and\\nlit by candles. Lady Anchorage had lately curtsied her farewell to the\\nlast royalty.\\n\\n\"How I hate staying up late,\" Brenda said, \"but it seems a shame to take\\nmy Mr Beaver away. He\\'s so thrilled to be here, bless him, and it was a\\ngreat effort to get him asked... Come to think of it,\" she added later,\\n\"I suppose that this is the last year _I_ shall be able to go to this\\nkind of party.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re going through with the divorce?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Jock. It doesn\\'t really depend on me. It\\'s all a matter\\nof holding down Mr Beaver. He\\'s getting very restive. I have to feed him\\na bit of high-life every week or so, and I suppose that\\'ll all stop if\\nthere\\'s a divorce. Any news of Tony?\"\\n\\n\"Not for some time now. I got a cable when he landed. He\\'s gone off on\\nsome expedition with a crook doctor.\"\\n\\n\"Is it _absolutely_ safe?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I imagine so. The whole world is civilized now, isn\\'t\\nit--charabancs and Cook\\'s offices everywhere.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I suppose it is... I hope he\\'s not _brooding_. I shouldn\\'t like\\nto think of him being unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"I expect he\\'s getting used to things.\"\\n\\n\"I do hope so. I\\'m very fond of Tony, you know, in spite of the\\nmonstrous way he behaved.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThere was an Indian village a mile or two distant from the camp. It was\\nhere that Tony and Dr Messinger proposed to recruit porters for the\\ntwo-hundred-mile march that lay between them and the Pie-wie country.\\nThe niggers were river men and could not be taken into Indian territory.\\nThey would go back with the boat.\\n\\nAt dawn Tony and Dr Messinger drank a mug each of hot cocoa and ate some\\nbiscuits and what was left over from the bully beef opened the night\\nbefore. Then they set out for the village. One of the blacks went in\\nfront with a cutlass to clear the trail. Dr Messinger and Tony followed,\\none behind the other; another black came behind them carrying samples of\\ntrade goods--a twenty-dollar Belgian gun, some rolls of printed cotton,\\nhand-mirrors in coloured celluloid frames, some bottles of highly\\nscented pomade.\\n\\nIt was a rough, unfrequented trail, encumbered by numerous fallen\\ntrunks; they waded knee-deep through two streams that ran to feed the\\nbig river; underfoot there was sometimes a hard network of bare root,\\nsometimes damp and slippery leaf-mould.\\n\\nPresently they reached the village. They came into sight of it quite\\nsuddenly, emerging from the bush into a wide clearing. There were eight\\nor nine circular huts of mud and palm thatch. No one was visible, but\\ntwo or three columns of smoke, rising straight and thin into the morning\\nair, told them that the place was inhabited.\\n\\n\"Dey people all afeared,\" said the black boy.\\n\\n\"Go and find someone to speak to us,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\nThe nigger went to the low door of the nearest house and peered in.\\n\\n\"Dere ain\\'t no one but women dere,\" he reported. \"Dey dressing\\ndeirselves. Come on out dere,\" he shouted into the gloom. \"De chief want\\ntalk to you.\"\\n\\nAt last, very shyly, a little old woman emerged, clad in the filthy\\ncalico gown that was kept for use in the presence of strangers. She\\nwaddled towards them on bandy legs. Her ankles were tightly bound with\\nblue beads. Her hair was lank and ragged; her eyes were fixed on the\\nearthenware bowl of liquid which she carried. When she was a few feet\\nfrom Tony and Dr Messinger she set the bowl on the ground, and, still\\nwith downcast eyes, shook hands with them. Then she stopped, picked up\\nthe bowl once more and held it to Dr Messinger.\\n\\n\"Gassiri,\" he explained, \"the local drink made of fermented cassava.\"\\n\\nHe drank some and handed the bowl to Tony. It contained a thick,\\npurplish liquid. When Tony had drunk a little, Dr Messinger explained,\\n\"It is made in an interesting way. The women chew the root up and spit\\nit into a hollow tree-trunk.\"\\n\\nHe then addressed the woman in Wapishiana. She looked at him for the\\nfirst time. Her brown, Mongol face was perfectly blank, devoid alike of\\ncomprehension and curiosity. Dr Messinger repeated and amplified his\\nquestion. The woman took the bowl from Tony and set it on the ground.\\n\\nMeanwhile other faces were appearing at the doors of the huts. Only one\\nwoman ventured out. She was very stout and she smiled confidently at the\\nvisitors.\\n\\n\"Good morning,\" she said. \"How do you do? I am Rosa. I speak English\\ngood. I live bottom-side two years with Mr Forbes. You give me\\ncigarette.\"\\n\\n\"Why doesn\\'t this woman answer?\"\\n\\n\"She no speak English.\"\\n\\n\"But I was speaking Wapishiana.\"\\n\\n\"She Macushi woman. All these people Macushi people.\"\\n\\n\"Oh. I didn\\'t know. Where are the men?\"\\n\\n\"Men all go hunting three days.\"\\n\\n\"When will they be back?\"\\n\\n\"They go after bush-pig.\"\\n\\n\"When will they be back?\"\\n\\n\"No, bush-pig. Plenty bush-pig. Men all go hunting. You give me\\ncigarette.\"\\n\\n\"Listen, Rosa, I want to go to the Pie-wie country.\"\\n\\n\"No, this Macushi. All the people Macushi.\"\\n\\n\"But we want to go Pie-wie.\"\\n\\n\"No, _all_ Macushi. You give me cigarette.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s hopeless,\" said Dr Messinger. \"We shall have to wait till the men\\ncome back.\" He took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket. \"Look,\" he\\nsaid, \"cigarettes.\"\\n\\n\"Give me.\"\\n\\n\"When men come back from hunting you come to river and tell me.\\nUnderstand?\"\\n\\n\"No, men hunting bush-pig. You give me cigarettes.\"\\n\\nDr Messinger gave her the cigarettes.\\n\\n\"What else you got?\" she said.\\n\\nDr Messinger pointed to the load which the second nigger had laid on the\\nground.\\n\\n\"Give me,\" she said.\\n\\n\"When men come back, I give you plenty things if men come with me to\\nPie-wies.\"\\n\\n\"No, _all_ Macushi here.\"\\n\\n\"We aren\\'t doing any good,\" said Dr Messinger. \"We\\'d better go back to\\ncamp and wait. The men have been away three days. It\\'s not likely they\\nwill be much longer... I wish I could speak Macushi.\"\\n\\nThey turned about, the four of them, and left the village. It was ten\\no\\'clock by Tony\\'s wrist watch when they reached their camp.\\n\\nTen o\\'clock on the river Waurupang was question time at Westminster. For\\na long time now Jock had had a question which his constituents wanted\\nhim to ask. It came up that afternoon.\\n\\n\"Number twenty,\" he said.\\n\\nA few members turned to the order paper.\\n\\n_No. 20._\\n\\n\"_To ask the Minister of Agriculture whether in view of the dumping in\\nthis country of Japanese pork pies, the right honourable member is\\nprepared to consider a modification of the eight-and-a-half-score basic\\npig from two and a half inches of thickness round the belly as\\noriginally specified, to two inches._\"\\n\\nReplying for the Minister, the under-secretary said: \"The matter is\\nreceiving the closest attention. As the honourable member is no doubt\\naware, the question of the importation of pork pies is a matter for the\\nBoard of Trade, not for the Board of Agriculture. With regard to the\\nspecifications of the basic pig, I must remind the honourable member\\nthat, as he is doubtless aware, the eight-and-a-half-score pig is\\nmodelled on the requirements of the bacon curers and has no direct\\nrelation to pig meat for sale in pies. That is being dealt with by a\\nseparate committee who have not yet made their report.\"\\n\\n\"Would the honourable member consider an increase of the specified\\nmaximum of fatness on the shoulders?\"\\n\\n\"I must have notice of that question.\"\\n\\nJock left the House that afternoon with the comfortable feeling that he\\nhad at last done something tangible in the interest of his constituents.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTwo days later the Indians returned from hunting. It was tedious\\nwaiting. Dr Messinger put in some hours daily in checking the stores.\\nTony went into the bush with his gun, but the game had all migrated from\\nthat part of the river bank. One of the black boys was badly injured in\\nthe foot and calf by a sting-ray; after that they stopped bathing and\\nwashed in a zinc pail. When the news of the Indians\\' return reached\\ncamp, Tony and Dr Messinger went to the village to see them, but a feast\\nhad already started and everyone in the place was drunk. The men lay in\\ntheir hammocks and the women trotted between them carrying calabashes of\\ncassiri. Everything reeked of roast pork.\\n\\n\"It will take them a week to get sober,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\nAll that week the black boys lounged in camp; sometimes they washed\\ntheir clothes and hung them out on the gunwales of the boat to dry in\\nthe sun; sometimes they went fishing and came back with a massive catch,\\nspeared on a stick (the flesh was tasteless and rubbery); usually in the\\nevenings they sang songs round the fire. The fellow who had been stung\\nkept to his hammock, groaning loudly and constantly asking for medicine.\\n\\nOn the sixth day the Indians began to appear. They shook hands all round\\nand then retired to the margin of the bush where they stood gazing at\\nthe camp equipment. Tony tried to photograph them but they ran away\\ngiggling like schoolgirls. Dr Messinger spread out on the ground the\\ngoods he had bought for barter.\\n\\nThey retired at sundown but on the seventh day they came again, greatly\\nreinforced. The entire population of the village was there. Rosa sat\\ndown on Tony\\'s hammock under the thatch roof.\\n\\n\"Give me cigarettes,\" she said.\\n\\n\"You tell them I want men to go Pie-wie country,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\n\"Pie-wie bad people. Macushi people no go with Pie-wie people.\"\\n\\n\"You say I want ten men. I give them guns.\"\\n\\n\"You give me cigarettes...\"\\n\\nNegotiations lasted for two days. Eventually twelve men agreed to come;\\nseven of them insisted on bringing their wives with them. One of these\\nwas Rosa. When everything was arranged there was a party in the village\\nand all the Indians got drunk again. This time, however, it was a\\nshorter business as the women had not had time to prepare much cassiri.\\nIn three days the caravan was able to set out.\\n\\nOne of the men had a long, single-barrelled, muzzle-loading gun; several\\nothers carried bows and arrows; they were naked except for red cotton\\ncloths round their loins. The women wore grubby calico dresses--they had\\nbeen issued to them years back by an itinerant preacher and kept for\\noccasions of this kind; they had wicker panniers on their shoulders,\\nsupported by a band across the forehead. All the heaviest luggage was\\ncarried by the women in these panniers, including the rations for\\nthemselves and their men. Rosa had, in addition, an umbrella with a\\ndented, silver crook, a relic of her association with Mr Forbes.\\n\\nThe Negroes returned downstream to the coast. A dump of provisions, in\\nsubstantial tin casing, was left in the ruinous shelter by the bank.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no one to touch it. We can send back for it in case of\\nemergency from the Pie-wie country,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\nTony and Dr Messinger walked immediately behind the man with the gun who\\nwas acting as guide; behind them the file straggled out for half a mile\\nor more through the forest.\\n\\n\"From now onwards the map is valueless to us,\" said Dr Messinger with\\nrelish.\\n\\n(Roll up the map--you will not need it again for how many years, said\\nWilliam Pitt... memories of Tony\\'s private school came back to him at\\nDr Messinger\\'s words, of inky little desks and a coloured picture of a\\nViking raid, of Mr Trotter who had taught him history and wore very\\nvivid ties.)\\n\\n\\n[III]\\n\\n\"Mummy, Brenda wants a job.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Just like everybody else, short of money and nothing to do. She\\nwondered if she could be any use to you at the shop.\"\\n\\n\"Well... It\\'s hard to say. At any other time she is exactly the kind of\\nsaleswoman I am always looking for... but I don\\'t know. _As things\\nare_, I\\'m not sure it would be wise.\"\\n\\n\"I said I\\'d ask you, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"John, you never tell me _anything_ and I don\\'t like to seem\\ninterfering; but what _is_ going to happen between you and Brenda?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"You never tell me _anything_,\" repeated Mrs Beaver. \"And there are so\\nmany rumours going round. Is there going to be a divorce?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\nMrs Beaver sighed. \"Well, I must get back to work. Where are you\\nlunching?\"\\n\\n\"Bratt\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Poor John. By the way, I thought you were joining Brown\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t heard anything from them. I don\\'t know whether they\\'ve had an\\nelection yet.\"\\n\\n\"Your father was a member.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve an idea I shan\\'t get in... anyway I couldn\\'t really afford it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not happy about you, John. I\\'m not sure that things are working out\\nas well as I hoped about Christmas-time.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s my telephone. Perhaps it\\'s Margot. She hasn\\'t asked me to\\nanything for weeks.\"\\n\\nBut it was only Brenda.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid mother\\'s got nothing for you at the shop,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Oh well. I expect something will turn up. I could do with a little good\\nluck just at the moment.\"\\n\\n\"So could I. Have you asked Allan about Brown\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I did. He says they elected about ten chaps last week.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, does that mean I\\'ve been blackballed?\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t know. Gentlemen are so odd about their clubs.\"\\n\\n\"I thought that you were going to make Allan and Reggie support me.\"\\n\\n\"I asked them. What does it matter anyway? D\\'you want to come to\\nVeronica\\'s for the week-end?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure that I do.\"\\n\\n\"_I\\'d_ like it.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a beastly little house--and I don\\'t think Veronica likes me.\\nWho\\'ll be there?\"\\n\\n\"I shall be.\"\\n\\n\"Yes... well, I\\'ll let you know.\"\\n\\n\"Am I seeing you this evening?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll let you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh dear,\" said Brenda as she rang off. \"Now he\\'s taken against me. It\\nisn\\'t my fault he can\\'t get into Brown\\'s. As a matter of fact I believe\\nReggie _did_ try to help.\"\\n\\nJenny Abdul Akbar was in the room with her. She came across every\\nmorning now in her dressing-gown and they read the newspaper together.\\nHer dressing-gown was of striped Berber silk.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go and have a cosy lunch at the Ritz,\" she said.\\n\\n\"The Ritz isn\\'t cosy at lunch-time and it costs eight and six. I daren\\'t\\ncash a cheque for three weeks, Jenny. The lawyers are so disagreeable.\\nI\\'ve never been like this before.\"\\n\\n\"What wouldn\\'t I do to Tony? Leaving you stranded like this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, what\\'s the good of knocking Tony? I don\\'t suppose he\\'s having a\\npacket of fun himself in Brazil or wherever it is.\"\\n\\n\"I hear they are putting in bathrooms at Hetton--while you are\\npractically starving. And he hasn\\'t even gone to Mrs Beaver for them.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I _do_ think that was mean.\"\\n\\nPresently Jenny went back to dress. Brenda telephoned to a delicatessen\\nstore round the corner for some sandwiches. She would spend that day in\\nbed, as she spent two or three days a week at this time. Perhaps, if\\nAllan was making a speech somewhere, as he usually was, Marjorie would\\nhave her to dinner. The Helm-Hubbards had a supper party that night but\\nBeaver had not been asked. \"If I went there without him it would be a\\nmajor bust-up... Come to think of it, Marjorie\\'s probably going. Well,\\nI can always have sandwiches for dinner here. They make all kinds. Thank\\nGod for the little shop round the corner.\" She was reading a biography\\nof Nelson that had lately appeared; it was very long and would keep her\\ngoing well into the night.\\n\\nAt one o\\'clock Jenny came in to say good-bye (she had a latch-key of\\nBrenda\\'s), dressed for a cosy lunch. \"I got Polly and Souki,\" she said.\\n\"We\\'re going to Daisy\\'s joint. I _wish_ you were coming.\"\\n\\n\"Me? Oh, I\\'m all right,\" said Brenda, and she thought, \"It might occur\\nto her to sock a girl a meal once in a way.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThey walked for a fortnight, averaging about fifteen miles a day.\\nSometimes they would do much more and sometimes much less; the Indian\\nwho went in front decided the camping places; they depended on water and\\nevil spirits.\\n\\nDr Messinger made a compass traverse of their route. It gave him\\nsomething to think about. He took readings every hour from an aneroid.\\nIn the evening, if they had halted early enough, he employed the last\\nhours of daylight in elaborating a chart. \"_Dry watercourse, three\\ndeserted huts, stony ground...._\"\\n\\n\"We are now in the Amazon system of rivers,\" he announced with\\nsatisfaction one day. \"You see, the water is running south.\" But almost\\nimmediately they crossed a stream flowing in the opposite direction.\\n\"Very curious,\" said Dr Messinger. \"A discovery of genuine scientific\\nvalue.\"\\n\\nNext day they waded through four streams at intervals of two miles,\\nrunning alternately north and south. The chart began to have a mythical\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Is there a name for any of these streams?\" he asked Rosa.\\n\\n\"Macushi people called him Waurupang.\"\\n\\n\"No, not the river where we first camped. _These rivers._\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Waurupang.\"\\n\\n\"_This river here._\"\\n\\n\"Macushi people call him all Waurupang.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s hopeless,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\nWhen they were near water they forced their way through blind bush; the\\ntrail there was grown over and barred by timber; only Indian eyes and\\nIndian memory could trace its course; sometimes they crossed little\\npatches of dry savannah, dun grass growing in tufts from the baked\\nearth; thousands of lizards scampered and darted before their feet and\\nthe grass rustled like newspaper; it was burning hot in these enclosed\\nspaces. Sometimes they climbed up into the wind, over loose red pebbles\\nthat bruised their feet; after these painful ascents they would lie in\\nthe wind till their wet clothes grew cold against their bodies; from\\nthese low eminences they could see other hill-tops and the belts of bush\\nthrough which they had travelled, and the file of porters trailing\\nbehind them. As each man and woman arrived he sank on to the dry grass\\nand rested against his load; when the last of them came up with the\\nparty Dr Messinger would give the word and they would start off again,\\ndescending into the green heart of the forest before them.\\n\\nTony and Dr Messinger seldom spoke to one another, either when they were\\nmarching or at the halts, for they were constantly strained and\\nexhausted. In the evenings after they had washed and changed into dry\\nshirts and flannel trousers, they talked a little, mostly about the\\nnumber of miles they had done that day, their probable position and the\\nstate of their feet. They drank rum and water after their bath; for\\nsupper there was usually bully beef stewed with rice and flour\\ndumplings. The Indians ate farine, smoked hog and occasional delicacies\\npicked up by the way--armadillo, iguana, fat white grubs from the palm\\ntrees. The women had some dried fish with them that lasted for eight\\ndays; the smell grew stronger every day until the stuff was eaten; then\\nit still hung about them and the stores, but grew fainter until it\\nmerged into the general, indefinable smell of the camp.\\n\\nThere were no Indians living in this country. In the last five days of\\nthe march they suffered from lack of water. The streams they came to\\nwere mostly dry; they had to reconnoitre up and down their beds in\\nsearch of tepid, stagnant puddles. But after two weeks they came to a\\nriver once more, flowing deep and swift to the south-east. This was the\\nborder of the Pie-wie country and Dr Messinger marked the place where\\nthey stopped Second Base Camp. The cabouri fly infested this stream in\\nclouds.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\n\"John, I think it\\'s time you had a holiday.\"\\n\\n\"A holiday what from, mumsy?\"\\n\\n\"A change... I\\'m going to California in July. To the Fischbaums--Mrs\\nArnold Fischbaum, not the one who lives in Paris. I think it would do\\nyou good to come with me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, mumsy.\"\\n\\n\"You _would_ like it, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Me? Yes, I\\'d like it.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve picked up that way of talking from Brenda. It sounds ridiculous\\nin a man.\"\\n\\n\"Sorry, mumsy.\"\\n\\n\"All right then, that\\'s settled.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nAt sunset the cabouri fly disappeared. Until then, through the day, it\\nwas necessary to keep covered; they settled on any exposed flesh like\\nhouse-flies upon jam; it was only when they were gorged that their bite\\nwas perceptible; they left behind a crimson, smarting circle with a\\nblack dot at its centre. Tony and Dr Messinger wore cotton gloves which\\nthey had brought for the purpose, and muslin veils, hanging down under\\ntheir hats. Later they employed two women to squat beside their hammocks\\nand fan them with leafy boughs; the slightest breeze was enough to\\ndisperse the flies, but as soon as Tony and Dr Messinger dozed the women\\nwould lay aside their work, and they woke instantly, stung in a hundred\\nplaces. The Indians bore the insects as cows bear horse-flies; passively\\nwith occasional fretful outbursts when they would slap their shoulders\\nand thighs.\\n\\nAfter dark there was some relief, for there were few mosquitoes at this\\ncamp, but they could hear the vampire bats all night long nuzzling and\\nflapping against their netting.\\n\\nThe Indians would not go hunting in this forest. They said there was no\\ngame, but Dr Messinger said it was because they were afraid of the evil\\nspirits of the Pie-wie people. Provisions were not lasting as well as Dr\\nMessinger had calculated. During the march it had been difficult to keep\\na proper guard over the stores. They were short of a bag of farine, half\\na bag of sugar and a bag of rice. Dr Messinger instituted careful\\nrationing; he served them himself, measuring everything strictly in an\\nenamel cup; even so, the women managed to get to the sugar behind his\\nback. He and Tony had finished the rum, except for one bottle which was\\nkept in case of emergency.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t go on breaking into tinned stores,\" said Dr Messinger\\npeevishly. \"The men must go out and shoot something.\"\\n\\nBut they received the orders with expressionless, downcast faces and\\nremained in camp.\\n\\n\"No birds, no animals here,\" explained Rosa. \"All gone. Maybe they get\\nsome fish.\"\\n\\nBut the Indians could not be persuaded to exert themselves. They could\\nsee the sacks and bales of food heaped on the bank; it would be plenty\\nof time to start hunting and fishing when that had been exhausted.\\n\\nMeanwhile there were canoes to be built.\\n\\n\"This is clearly Amazon water,\" said Dr Messinger. \"It probably flows\\ninto the Rio Branco or the Rio Negro. The Pie-wies live along the bank,\\nand the City, from all accounts, must be downstream of us, up one of the\\ntributaries. When we reach the first Pie-wie village we will be able to\\nget guides.\"\\n\\nThe canoes were made of woodskin. Three days were spent in finding trees\\nof suitable age and straightness and in felling them. They cut four\\ntrees and worked on them where they lay, clearing the bush for a few\\nfeet round them. They stripped the bark with their broad-bladed knives;\\nthat took another week. They worked patiently but clumsily; one woodskin\\nwas split in getting it off the trunk. There was nothing Tony and Dr\\nMessinger could do to help. They spent that week guarding the sugar from\\nthe women. As the men moved about the camp and the surrounding bush,\\ntheir steps were soundless; their bare feet seemed never to disturb the\\nfallen leaves, their bare shoulders made no rustle in the tangled\\nundergrowth; their speech was brief and scarcely audible, they never\\njoined in the chatter and laughter of their women; sometimes they gave\\nlittle grunts as they worked; only once they were merry, when one of\\nthem let his knife slip as he was working on the tree-trunk and cut\\ndeeply into the ball of his thumb. Dr Messinger dressed the wound with\\niodine, lint and bandages. After that the women constantly solicited\\nhim, showing him little scratches on their arms and legs and asking for\\niodine.\\n\\nTwo of the trees were finished on one day, then another next day (that\\nwas the one which split) and the fourth two days after that; it was a\\nlarger tree than the others. When the last fibre was severed, four men\\ngot round the trunk and lifted the skin clear. It curled up again at\\nonce, making a hollow cylinder, which the men carried down to the\\nwaterside and set afloat, fastening it to a tree with a loop of\\nvine-rope.\\n\\nWhen all the woodskins were ready it was an easy matter to make canoes\\nof them. Four men held them open while two others fixed the struts. The\\nends were left open, and curled up slightly so as to lift them clear\\n(when the craft was fully laden it drew only an inch or two of water).\\nThen the men set about fashioning some single-bladed paddles; that, too,\\nwas an easy matter.\\n\\nEvery day Dr Messinger asked Rosa, \"When will the boats be ready? Ask\\nthe men.\" And she replied, \"Just now.\"\\n\\n\"How many days--four?--five?--how many?\"\\n\\n\"No, not many. Boats finish just now.\"\\n\\nAt last when it was clear that the work was nearly complete, Dr\\nMessinger busied himself with arrangements. He sorted out the stores,\\ndividing the necessary freight into two groups; he and Tony were to sit\\nin separate boats and each had with him a rifle and ammunition, a\\ncamera, tinned rations, trade goods and his own luggage. The third\\ncanoe, which would be manned solely by Indians, was to hold the flour\\nand rice, sugar and farine and the rations for the men. The canoes would\\nnot hold all the stores and an \"emergency dump\" was made a little way up\\nthe bank.\\n\\n\"We shall take eight men with us. Four can stay behind with the women to\\nguard the camp. Once we are among the Pie-wies, everything will be easy.\\nThese Macushis can go home then. I don\\'t think they will rob the stores.\\nThere is nothing here that would be much use to them.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t we better keep Rosa with us to act as interpreter with the\\nMacushis?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, perhaps we had. I will tell her.\"\\n\\nThat evening everything was finished except the paddles. In the first\\nexhilarating hour of darkness, when Tony and Dr Messinger were able to\\ndiscard the gloves and veils that had been irking them all day, they\\ncalled Rosa across to the part of the camp where they ate and slept.\\n\\n\"Rosa, we have decided to take you down the river with us. We need you\\nto help us talk to the men. Understand?\"\\n\\nRosa said nothing; her face was perfectly blank, lit from below by the\\nstorm lantern that stood on a box between them; the shadow of her high\\ncheekbones hid her eyes; lank, ragged hair, a tenuous straggle of\\ntattooing along the forehead and lip, rotund body in its filthy cotton\\ngown, bandy brown legs.\\n\\n\"Understand?\"\\n\\nBut still she said nothing; she seemed to be looking over their heads\\ninto the dark forest, but her eyes were lost in shadow.\\n\\n\"Listen, Rosa, all women and four men stay here in camp. Eight men come\\nin boats to Pie-wie village. You come with boats. When we reach Pie-wie\\nvillage, you and eight men and boats go back to camp to other women and\\nmen. Then back to Macushi country. Understand?\"\\n\\nAt last Rosa spoke. \"Macushi peoples no go with Pie-wie peoples.\"\\n\\n\"I am not asking you to go _with_ Pie-wie people. You and the men take\\nus as far as Pie-wies, then you go back to Macushi people. Understand?\"\\n\\nRosa raised her arm in an embracing circle which covered the camp and\\nthe road they had travelled and the broad savannahs behind them.\\n\"Macushi peoples there,\" she said. Then she raised the other arm and\\nwaved it downstream towards the hidden country. \"Pie-wie peoples there,\"\\nshe said. \"Macushi peoples no go with Pie-wie peoples.\"\\n\\n\"Now listen, Rosa. You are sensible, civilized woman. You lived two\\nyears with black gentleman, Mr Forbes. You like cigarettes--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, give me cigarettes.\"\\n\\n\"You come with men in boats, I give you plenty, plenty cigarettes.\"\\n\\nRosa looked stolidly ahead of her and said nothing.\\n\\n\"Listen. You will have your man and seven others to protect you. How can\\nwe talk with men without you?\"\\n\\n\"Men no go,\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\"Of course the men will go. The only question is, will you come too?\"\\n\\n\"Macushi peoples no go with Pie-wie peoples,\" said Rosa.\\n\\n\"Oh God,\" said Dr Messinger wearily. \"All right, we\\'ll talk about it in\\nthe morning.\"\\n\\n\"You give me cigarette....\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s going to be awkward if that woman doesn\\'t come.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s going to be much more awkward if none of them come,\" said Tony.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nNext day the boats were ready. By noon they were launched and tied in to\\nthe bank. The Indians went silently about the business of preparing\\ntheir dinner. Tony and Dr Messinger ate tongue, boiled rice and some\\ntinned peaches.\\n\\n\"We\\'re all right for stores,\" said Dr Messinger. \"There\\'s enough for\\nthree weeks at the shortest and we are bound to come across the Pie-wies\\nin a day or two. We will start to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThe Indians\\' wages, in rifles, fish hooks and rolls of cotton, had been\\nleft behind for them at their village. There were still half a dozen\\nboxes of \"trade\" for use during the later stages of the journey. A leg\\nof bush-pig was worth a handful of shot or twenty gun caps in that\\ncurrency; a fat game-bird cost a necklace.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, at about one o\\'clock, Dr Messinger called Rosa\\nover to them. \"We start to-morrow,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes, just now.\"\\n\\n\"Tell the men what I told you last night. Eight men to come in boats,\\nothers wait here. You come in boats. All these stores stay here. All\\nthese stores go in boats. You tell men that.\"\\n\\nRosa said nothing.\\n\\n\"Understand?\"\\n\\n\"No peoples go in boats,\" she said. \"All peoples go this way,\" and she\\nextended her arm towards the trail that they had lately followed.\\n\"To-morrow or next day all people go back to village.\"\\n\\nThere was a long pause; at last Dr Messinger said, \"You tell the men to\\ncome here.... It\\'s no use threatening them,\" he remarked to Tony when\\nRosa had waddled back to the fireside. \"They are a queer, timid lot. If\\nyou threaten them they take fright and disappear, leaving you stranded.\\nDon\\'t worry, I shall be able to persuade them.\"\\n\\nThey could see Rosa talking at the fireside but none of the group moved.\\nPresently, having delivered her message, she was silent and squatted\\ndown among them with the head of one of the women between her knees. She\\nhad been searching it for lice when Dr Messinger\\'s summons had\\ninterrupted her.\\n\\n\"We\\'d better go across and talk to them.\"\\n\\nSome of the Indians were in hammocks. The others were squatting on their\\nheels; they had scraped earth over the fire and extinguished it. They\\ngazed at Tony and Dr Messinger with slit, pig eyes. Only Rosa seemed\\nincurious; her head was averted; all her attention went to her busy\\nfingers as she picked and crunched the lice from her friend\\'s hair.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Dr Messinger. \"I told you to bring the men\\nhere.\"\\n\\nRosa said nothing.\\n\\n\"So Macushi people are cowards. They are afraid of Pie-wie people.\"\\n\\n\"It is the cassava field,\" said Rosa. \"We must go back to dig the\\ncassava. Otherwise it will be bad.\"\\n\\n\"Listen. I want the men for one, two weeks. No more. After that, all\\nfinish. They can go home.\"\\n\\n\"It is the time to dig the cassava. Macushi people dig cassava before\\nthe big rains. All people go home just now.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s pure blackmail,\" said Dr Messinger. \"Let\\'s get out some trade\\ngoods.\"\\n\\nHe and Tony together prised open one of the cases and began to spread\\nout the contents on a blanket. They had chosen these things together at\\na cheap store in Oxford Street. The Indians watched the display in\\nunbroken silence. There were bottles of scent and pills, bright\\ncelluloid combs set with glass jewels, mirrors, pocket knives with\\nembossed aluminium handles, ribbons and necklaces and barter of more\\nsolid worth in the form of axe heads, brass cartridge cases and flat,\\nred flasks of gunpowder.\\n\\n\"You give me this,\" said Rosa picking out a pale blue rosette, that had\\nbeen made as a boat race favour. \"Give me this,\" she repeated, rubbing\\nsome drops of scent into the palm of her hands and inhaling deeply.\\n\\n\"Each man can choose three things from this box if he comes in the\\nboats.\"\\n\\nBut Rosa replied monotonously, \"Macushi peoples dig cassava field just\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no good,\" said Dr Messinger after half an hour\\'s fruitless\\nnegotiation. \"We shall have to try with the mice. I wanted to keep them\\ntill we reached the Pie-wies. It\\'s a pity. But they\\'ll fall for the\\nmice, you see. I _know_ the Indian mind.\"\\n\\nThese mice were comparatively expensive articles; they had cost three\\nand sixpence each, and Tony remembered vividly the embarrassment with\\nwhich he had witnessed their demonstration on the floor of the toy\\ndepartment.\\n\\nThey were of German manufacture; the size of large rats, but\\nconspicuously painted in spots of green and white; they had large glass\\neyes, stiff whiskers and green-and-white-ringed tails; they ran on\\nhidden wheels, and inside them were little bells that jingled as they\\nmoved. Dr Messinger took one out of their box, unwrapped the\\ntissue-paper and held it up to general scrutiny. There was no doubt that\\nhe had captured his audience\\'s interest. Then he wound it up. The\\nIndians stirred apprehensively at the sound.\\n\\nThe ground where they were camping was hard mud, inundated at flood\\ntime. Dr Messinger put the toy down at his feet and set it going;\\ntinkling merrily it ran towards the group of Indians. For a moment, Tony\\nwas afraid that it would turn over or become stuck against a root, but\\nthe mechanism was unimpaired and by good chance there was a clear\\ncourse. The effect exceeded anything that he had expected. There was a\\nloud intake of breath, a series of horrified, small grunts, a high wail\\nof terror from the women, and a sudden stampede; a faint patter of bare\\nbrown feet among the fallen leaves, bare limbs, quiet as bats, pushed\\nthrough the undergrowth, ragged cotton gowns caught and tore in the\\nthorn bushes. Before the toy had run down, before it had jingled its way\\nto the place where the nearest Indian had been squatting, the camp was\\nempty.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m damned,\" said Dr Messinger, \"that\\'s better than I expected.\"\\n\\n\"More than you expected, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s all right. They\\'ll come back. I know them.\"\\n\\nBut by sundown there was still no sign. Throughout the hot afternoon\\nTony and Dr Messinger, shrouded from cabouri fly, sprawled in their\\nhammocks. The empty canoes lay in the river; the mechanical mouse had\\nbeen put away. At sundown Dr Messinger said, \"We\\'d better make a fire.\\nThey\\'ll come back when it is dark.\"\\n\\nThey brushed the earth away from the old embers, brought new wood and\\nmade a fire; they lit the storm lantern.\\n\\n\"We\\'d better get some supper,\" said Tony.\\n\\nThey boiled water and made some cocoa, opened a tin of salmon and\\nfinished the peaches that were left over from mid-day. They lit their\\npipes and drew the sheaths of mosquito netting across their hammocks.\\nMost of this time they were silent. Presently they decided to go to\\nsleep.\\n\\n\"We shall find them all here in the morning,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\"They\\'re an odd bunch.\"\\n\\nAll round them the voices of the bush whistled and croaked, changing\\nwith the hours as the night wore on to morning.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nDawn broke in London, clear and sweet, dove grey and honey, with promise\\nof good weather; the lamps in the streets paled and disappeared; the\\nempty streets ran with water, and the rising sun caught it as it bubbled\\nround the hydrants; the men in overalls swung the nozzles of their hoses\\nfrom side to side and the water jetted and cascaded in a sparkle of\\nlight.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s have the window open,\" said Brenda. \"It\\'s stuffy in here.\"\\n\\nThe waiter drew back the curtains, opened the windows.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite light,\" she added.\\n\\n\"After five. Oughtn\\'t we to go to bed?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Only another week and then all the parties will be over,\" said Beaver.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s go.\"\\n\\n\"All right. Can you pay? I just haven\\'t any money.\"\\n\\nThey had come on after the party, for breakfast at a club Daisy had\\nopened. Beaver paid for the kippers and tea. \"Eight shillings,\" he said.\\n\"How does Daisy expect to make a success of the place when she charges\\nprices like that?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem a lot.... So you really _are_ going to America?\"\\n\\n\"I must. Mother has taken the tickets.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing I\\'ve said to-night makes any difference?\"\\n\\n\"Darling, don\\'t go on. We\\'ve been through all that. You know it\\'s the\\nonly thing that _can_ happen. Why spoil the last week?\"\\n\\n\"You _have_ enjoyed the summer, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Of course... well, shall we go?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. You needn\\'t bother to see me home.\"\\n\\n\"Sure you don\\'t mind? It _is_ miles out of the way and it\\'s late.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no knowing what I mind.\"\\n\\n\"Brenda, darling, for heaven\\'s sake... It isn\\'t like you to go on like\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\"I never was one for making myself expensive.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThe Indians returned during the night, while Tony and Dr Messinger were\\nasleep; without a word spoken the little people crept out of hiding; the\\nwomen had removed their clothes and left them at a distance so that no\\ntwig should betray their movements; their naked bodies moved soundlessly\\nthrough the undergrowth; the glowing embers of the fire and the storm\\nlantern twenty yards away were their only light; there was no moon. They\\ncollected their wicker baskets and their rations of farine, their bows\\nand arrows, the gun and their broad-bladed knives; they rolled up their\\nhammocks into compact cylinders. They took nothing with them that was\\nnot theirs. Then they crept back through the shadows, into the darkness.\\n\\nWhen Tony and Dr Messinger awoke it was clear to them what had happened.\\n\\n\"The situation is grave,\" said Dr Messinger. \"But not desperate.\"\\n\\n\\n[IV]\\n\\nFor four days Tony and Dr Messinger paddled downstream. They sat,\\nbalancing themselves precariously, at the two ends of the canoe; between\\nthem they had piled the most essential of their stores; the remainder,\\nwith the other canoes, had been left at the camp, to be called for when\\nthey had recruited help from the Pie-wies. Even the minimum which Dr\\nMessinger had selected over-weighted the craft so that it was\\ndangerously low; any movement brought the water to the lip of the\\ngunwale and threatened disaster; it was heavy to steer and they made\\nslow progress, contenting themselves, for the most part, with keeping\\nend on, and drifting with the current.\\n\\nTwice they came to stretches of cataract, and here they drew in to the\\nbank, unloaded and waded beside the boat, sometimes plunging waist-deep,\\nsometimes clambering over the rocks, guiding it by hand until they\\nreached clear water again. Then they tied up to the bank and carried\\ntheir cargo down to it through the bush. For the rest of the way the\\nriver was broad and smooth; a dark surface which reflected in fine\\ndetail the walls of forest on either side, towering up from the\\nundergrowth to their blossoming crown a hundred or more feet above them.\\nSometimes they came to a stretch of water scattered with fallen petals\\nand floated among them, moving scarcely less slowly than they, as though\\nresting in a flowering meadow. At night they spread their tarpaulin on\\nstretches of dry beach, or hung their hammocks in the bush. Only the\\ncabouri fly and rare, immobile alligators menaced the peace of their\\ndays.\\n\\nThey kept a constant scrutiny of the banks but saw no sign of human\\nlife.\\n\\nThen Tony developed fever. It came on him quite suddenly, during the\\nfourth afternoon. At their mid-day halt he was in complete health and\\nshot a small deer that came down to drink on the opposite bank; an hour\\nlater he was shivering so violently that he had to lay down his paddle;\\nhis head was flaming with heat, his body and limbs were frigid; by\\nsunset he was slightly delirious.\\n\\nDr Messinger took his temperature and found that it was a hundred and\\nfour degrees, Fahrenheit. He gave him twenty-five grains of quinine and\\nlit a fire so close to his hammock that by morning it was singed and\\nblacked with smoke. He told Tony to keep wrapped up in his blanket, but\\nat intervals throughout that night he woke from sleep to find himself\\nrunning with sweat; he was consumed with thirst and drank mug after mug\\nof river water. Neither that evening nor next morning was he able to eat\\nanything.\\n\\nBut next morning his temperature was down again. He felt weak and\\nexhausted but he was able to keep steady in his place and paddle a\\nlittle.\\n\\n\"It was just a passing attack, wasn\\'t it?\" he said. \"I shall be\\nperfectly fit to-morrow, shan\\'t I?\"\\n\\n\"I hope so,\" said Dr Messinger.\\n\\nAt mid-day Tony drank some cocoa and ate a cupful of rice. \"I feel\\ngrand,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Good.\"\\n\\nThat night the fever came on again. They were camping on a sand bank. Dr\\nMessinger heated stones and put them under Tony\\'s feet and in the small\\nof his back. He was awake most of the night fuelling the fire and\\nrefilling Tony\\'s mug with water. At dawn Tony slept for an hour and woke\\nfeeling slightly better; he was taking frequent doses of quinine and his\\nears were filled with a muffled sound as though he were holding those\\nshells to them in which, he had been told in childhood, one could hear\\nthe beat of the sea.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to go on,\" said Dr Messinger. \"We can\\'t be far from a village\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"I feel awful. Wouldn\\'t it be better to wait a day till I am perfectly\\nfit again?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no good waiting. We\\'ve got to get on. D\\'you think you can manage\\nto get into the canoe?\"\\n\\nDr Messinger knew that Tony was in for a long bout.\\n\\nFor the first few hours of that day Tony lay limp in the bows. They had\\nshifted the stores so that he could lie full length. Then the fever came\\non again and his teeth chattered. He sat up and crouched with his head\\nin his knees, shaking all over; only his forehead and cheeks were\\nburning hot under the noon sun. There was still no sign of a village.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nIt was late in the afternoon when he first saw Brenda. For some time he\\nhad been staring intently at the odd shape amidships where the stores\\nhad been piled; then he realized that it was a human being.\\n\\n\"So the Indians came back?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I knew they would. Silly of them to be scared by a toy. I suppose the\\nothers are following.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I expect so. Try and sit still.\"\\n\\n\"Damned fool, being frightened of a toy mouse,\" Tony said derisively to\\nthe woman amidships. Then he saw that it was Brenda. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he\\nsaid. \"I didn\\'t see it was you. You wouldn\\'t be frightened of a toy\\nmouse.\"\\n\\nBut she did not answer him. She sat as she used often to sit when she\\ncame back from London, huddled over her bowl of bread and milk.\\n\\nDr Messinger steered the boat in to the side. They nearly capsized as he\\nhelped Tony out. Brenda got ashore without assistance. She stepped out\\nin her delicate, competent way, keeping the balance of the boat.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what poise means,\" said Tony. \"D\\'you know, I once saw a\\nquestionnaire that people had to fill in when they applied for a job in\\nan American firm, and one of the things they had to answer was \"Have you\\npoise?\"\"\\n\\nBrenda was at the top of the bank waiting for him. \"What was so absurd\\nabout the question was that they only had the applicant\\'s word for it,\"\\nhe explained laboriously. \"I mean--is it a sign of poise to think you\\nhave it?\"\\n\\n\"Just sit quiet here while I sling your hammock.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll sit here with Brenda. I am so glad she could come. She must\\nhave caught the three-eighteen.\"\\n\\nShe was with him all that night and all the next day. He talked to her\\nceaselessly but her replies were rare and enigmatic. On the succeeding\\nevening he had another fit of sweating. Dr Messinger kept a large fire\\nburning by the hammock and wrapped Tony in his own blanket. An hour\\nbefore dawn Tony fell asleep and when he awoke Brenda had gone.\\n\\n\"You\\'re down to normal again.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God. I\\'ve been pretty ill, haven\\'t I? I can\\'t remember much.\"\\n\\nDr Messinger had made something of a camp. He had chopped a square clear\\nof undergrowth, the size of a small room. Their two hammocks hung on\\nopposite sides of it. The stores were all ashore, arranged in an orderly\\npile on the tarpaulin.\\n\\n\"How d\\'you feel?\"\\n\\n\"Grand,\" said Tony, but when he got out of his hammock he found he could\\nnot stand without help. \"Of course, I haven\\'t eaten anything. I expect\\nit will be a day or two before I\\'m really well.\"\\n\\nDr Messinger said nothing, but strained the tea clear of leaves by\\npouring it slowly from one mug into another; he stirred into it a large\\nspoonful of condensed milk.\\n\\n\"See if you can drink this.\"\\n\\nTony drank it with pleasure and ate some biscuits.\\n\\n\"Are we going on to-day?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll think about it.\" He took the mugs down to the bank and washed\\nthem in the river. When he came back he said, \"I think I\\'d better\\nexplain things. It\\'s no use your thinking you are cured because you are\\nout of fever for one day. That\\'s the way it goes. One day fever and one\\nday normal. It may take a week or it may take much longer. That\\'s a\\nthing we\\'ve got to face. I can\\'t risk taking you in the canoe. You\\nnearly upset us several times the day before yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"I thought there was someone there I knew.\"\\n\\n\"You thought a lot of things. It\\'ll go on like that. Meanwhile we\\'ve\\nprovisions for about ten days. There\\'s no immediate anxiety there but\\nit\\'s a thing to remember. Besides, what you need is a roof over your\\nhead and constant nursing. If only we were at a village....\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I\\'m being a great nuisance.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the point. The thing is to find what is best for us to do.\"\\n\\nBut Tony felt too tired to think; he dozed for an hour or so. When he\\nawoke, Dr Messinger was cutting back the bush farther. \"I\\'m going to fix\\nup the tarpaulin as a roof.\"\\n\\n(He had marked this place on his map _Temporary Emergency Base Camp_.)\\n\\nTony watched him listlessly. Presently he said, \"Look here, why don\\'t\\nyou leave me here and go down the river for help?\"\\n\\n\"I thought of that. It\\'s too big a risk.\"\\n\\nThat afternoon Brenda was back at Tony\\'s side and he was shivering and\\ntossing in his hammock.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nWhen he was next able to observe things, Tony noted that there was a\\ntarpaulin over his head, slung to the tree-trunks. He asked, \"How long\\nhave we been here?\"\\n\\n\"Only three days.\"\\n\\n\"What time is it now?\"\\n\\n\"Getting on for ten in the morning.\"\\n\\n\"I feel awful.\"\\n\\nDr Messinger gave him some soup. \"I am going downstream for the day,\" he\\nsaid, \"to see if there\\'s any sign of a village. I hate leaving you but\\nit\\'s a chance worth taking. I shall be able to get a long way in the\\ncanoe now it\\'s empty. Lie quiet. Don\\'t move from the hammock. I shall be\\nback before night. I hope with some Indians to help.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Tony and fell asleep.\\n\\nDr Messinger went down to the river\\'s edge and untied the canoe; he\\nbrought with him a rifle, a drinking cup and a day\\'s provisions. He sat\\nin the stern and pushed out from the bank; the current carried the bows\\ndown and in a few strokes of the paddle he was in midstream.\\n\\nThe sun was high and its reflection in the water dazzled and scorched\\nhim; he paddled on with regular, leisurely strokes; he was travelling\\nfast. For a mile\\'s stretch the river narrowed and the water raced so\\nthat all he had to do was to trail the blade of the paddle as a rudder;\\nthen the walls of forest on either side of him fell back and he drifted\\ninto a great open lake, where he had to work heavily to keep in motion;\\nall the time he watched keenly to right and left for the column of\\nsmoke, the thatched dome, the sly brown figure in the undergrowth, the\\ndrinking cattle, that would disclose the village he sought. But there\\nwas no sign. In the open water he took up his field-glasses and studied\\nthe whole wooded margin. But there was no sign.\\n\\nLater the river narrowed once more and the canoe shot forward in the\\nswift current. Ahead of him the surface was broken by rapids; the smooth\\nwater seethed and eddied; a low monotone warned him that beyond the\\nrapids was a fall. Dr Messinger began to steer for the bank. The current\\nwas running strongly and he exerted his full strength; ten yards from\\nthe beginning of the rapids his bows ran in under the bank. There was a\\ndense growth of thorn here, overhanging the river, the canoe slid under\\nthem and bit into the beach; very cautiously Dr Messinger knelt forward\\nin his place and stretched up to a bough over his head. It was at that\\nmoment he came to grief; the stern swung out downstream and as he\\nsnatched at the paddle the craft was swept broadside into the troubled\\nwaters; there it adopted an eccentric course, spinning and tumbling to\\nthe falls. Dr Messinger was tipped into the water; it was quite shallow\\nin places and he caught at the rocks but they were worn smooth as ivory\\nand afforded no hold for his hands; he rolled over twice, found himself\\nin deep water and attempted to swim, found himself among boulders again\\nand attempted to grapple with them. Then he reached the falls.\\n\\nThey were unspectacular as falls go in that country--a drop of ten feet\\nor less--but they were enough for Dr Messinger. At their foot the foam\\nsubsided into a great pool, almost still, and strewn with blossom from\\nthe forest trees that encircled it. Dr Messinger\\'s hat floated very\\nslowly towards the Amazon and the water closed over his bald head.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda went to see the family solicitors.\\n\\n\"Mr Graceful,\" she said, \"I\\'ve got to have some more money.\"\\n\\nMr Graceful looked at her sadly. \"I should have thought that was really\\na question for your bank manager. I understand that your securities are\\nin your own name and that the dividends are paid into your account.\"\\n\\n\"They never seem to pay dividends nowadays. Besides, it\\'s really very\\ndifficult to live on so little.\"\\n\\n\"No doubt. No doubt.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Last left you with power of attorney, didn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"With strictly limited powers, Lady Brenda. I am instructed to pay the\\nwage bill at Hetton and all expenses connected with the upkeep of the\\nestate--he is putting in new bathrooms and restoring some decorations in\\nthe morning-room which had been demolished. But I am afraid that I have\\nno authority to draw on Mr Last\\'s account for other charges.\"\\n\\n\"But, Mr Graceful, I am sure he didn\\'t intend to stay abroad so long. He\\ncan\\'t possibly have meant to leave me stranded like this, can he?...\\nCan he?\"\\n\\nMr Graceful paused and fidgeted a little. \"To be quite frank, Lady\\nBrenda, I fear that _was_ his intention. I raised this particular point\\nshortly before his departure. He was quite resolved on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"But is he _allowed_ to do that? I mean, haven\\'t I got any rights under\\nthe marriage settlement or anything?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing which you can claim without application to the courts. You\\n_might_ find solicitors who would advise you to take action. I cannot\\nsay that I should be one of them. Mr Last would oppose any such order to\\nthe utmost and I think that, in the present circumstances, the courts\\nwould undoubtedly find for him. In any case it would be a prolonged,\\ncostly and slightly undignified proceeding.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see... well, that\\'s that, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"It certainly looks as though it were.\"\\n\\nBrenda rose to go. It was high summer and through the open windows she\\ncould see the sun-bathed gardens of Lincoln\\'s Inn.\\n\\n\"There\\'s one thing. Do you know, I mean, can you tell me whether Mr Last\\nmade another will?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid that is a thing I cannot discuss.\"\\n\\n\"No, I suppose not. I\\'m sorry if it was wrong to ask. I just wanted to\\nknow how I am with him.\"\\n\\nShe still stood between the door and the table, looking lost, in her\\nbright summer clothes. \"Perhaps I can say as much as this to guide you.\\nThe heirs-presumptive to Hetton are now his cousins, the Richard Lasts\\nat Princes Risborough. I think that your knowledge of Mr Last\\'s\\ncharacter and opinions will tell you that he would always wish his\\nfortune to go with the estate, in order that it may be preserved in what\\nhe holds to be its right condition.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Brenda, \"I ought to have thought of that. Well, good-bye.\"\\n\\nAnd she went out alone into the sunshine.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nAll that day Tony lay alone, fitfully oblivious of the passage of time.\\nHe slept a little; once or twice he left his hammock and found himself\\nweak and dizzy. He tried to eat some of the food which Dr Messinger had\\nleft out for him, but without success. It was not until it grew dark\\nthat he realized the day was over. He lit the lantern and began to\\ncollect wood for the fire, but the sticks kept slipping from his fingers\\nand each time that he stooped he felt giddy, so that after a few fretful\\nefforts he left them where they had fallen and returned to his hammock.\\nAnd lying there, wrapped in his blanket, he began to cry.\\n\\nAfter some hours of darkness the lamp began to burn low; he leant\\npainfully over, and shook it. It needed refilling. He knew where the oil\\nwas kept, crept to it, supporting himself first on the hammock rope and\\nthen on a pile of boxes. He found the keg, pulled out the bung and began\\nto refill the lamp, but his hand trembled and the oil spilled over the\\nground, then his head began to swim again so that he shut his eyes; the\\nkeg rolled over on its side and emptied itself with slow gurglings. When\\nhe realized what had happened, he began to cry again. He lay down in his\\nhammock and in a few minutes the light sank, flickered and went out.\\nThere was a reek of kerosene on his hands and on the sodden earth. He\\nlay awake in the darkness crying.\\n\\nJust before dawn the fever returned and a constant company of phantoms\\nperplexed his senses.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nBrenda awoke in the lowest possible spirits. The evening before she had\\nspent alone at a cinema. Afterwards she felt hungry--she had had no\\nproper meal that day--but she had not the strength to go alone into any\\nof the supper restaurants. She bought a meat pie at a coffee stall and\\ntook it home. It looked delicious but when she came to eat she found\\nthat she had lost her appetite. The remains of that pie lay on the\\ndressing table when she awoke.\\n\\nIt was August and she was entirely alone. Beaver was that day landing in\\nNew York. (He had cabled her from mid-ocean that the crossing was\\nexcellent.) It was for her the last of Beaver. Parliament was over and\\nJock Grant-Menzies was paying his annual visit to his elder brother in\\nScotland; Marjorie and Allan at the last moment had made Lord Monomark\\'s\\nyacht and were drifting luxuriously down the coast of Spain attending\\nbull-fights (they had even asked her to look after Djinn). Her mother\\nwas at the chalet Lady Anchorage always lent her on the Lake of Geneva.\\nPolly was everywhere. Even Jenny Abdul Akbar was cruising in the Baltic.\\n\\nBrenda opened her newspaper and read an article by a young man who said\\nthat the London Season was a thing of the past; that everyone was too\\nbusy in those days to keep up the pre-war routine; that there were no\\nmore formal dances but a constant round of more modest entertaining;\\nthat August in London was the gayest time of all (he rewrote this\\nannually in slightly different words). It did not console Brenda to read\\nthat article.\\n\\nFor weeks past she had attempted to keep a fair mind towards Tony and\\nhis treatment of her; now at last she broke down, and turning over\\nburied her face in the pillow in an agony of resentment and self-pity.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nIn Brazil she wore a ragged cotton gown of the same pattern as Rosa\\'s.\\nIt was not unbecoming. Tony watched her for some time before he spoke.\\n\"Why are you dressed like that?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you like it? I got it from Polly.\"\\n\\n\"It looks so dirty.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Polly travels about a lot. You must get up now to go to the\\nCounty Council meeting.\"\\n\\n\"But it isn\\'t Wednesday?\"\\n\\n\"No, but time is different in Brazil; surely you remember?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t get as far as Pigstanton. I\\'ve got to stay here until Messinger\\ncomes back. I\\'m ill. He told me to be quiet. He\\'s coming this evening.\"\\n\\n\"But all the County Council are here. The Shameless Blonde brought them\\nin her aeroplane.\"\\n\\nSure enough they were all there. Reggie St Cloud was chairman. He said,\\n\"I strongly object to Milly being on the committee. She is a woman of\\nlow repute.\"\\n\\nTony protested. \"She has a daughter. She has as much right here as Lady\\nCockpurse.\"\\n\\n\"Order,\" said the Mayor. \"I must ask you gentlemen to confine your\\nremarks to the subject under discussion. We have to decide about the\\nwidening of the Bayton-Pigstanton road. There have been several\\ncomplaints that it\\'s impossible for the Green Line buses to turn the\\ncorner safely at Hetton Cross.\"\\n\\n\"Green Line _rats_.\"\\n\\n\"I said Green Line rats. Mechanical green line rats. Many of the\\nvillagers have been scared by them and have evacuated their cottages.\"\\n\\n\"I evacuated,\" said Reggie St Cloud. \"I was driven out of my house by\\nmechanical green rats.\"\\n\\n\"Order,\" said Polly Cockpurse. \"I move that Mr Last address the\\nmeeting.\"\\n\\n\"Hear, hear.\"\\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Tony. \"I beg you to understand that I am\\nill and must not move from the hammock. Dr Messinger has given the\\nclearest instructions.\"\\n\\n\"Winnie wants to bathe.\"\\n\\n\"No bathing in Brazil. No bathing in Brazil.\" The meeting took up the\\ncry. \"No bathing in Brazil.\"\\n\\n\"But you had two breakfasts.\"\\n\\n\"Order,\" said the Mayor. \"Lord St Cloud, I suggest you put the question\\nto the vote.\"\\n\\n\"The question is whether the contract for the widening of the corner of\\nHetton Cross shall be given to Mrs Beaver. Of the tenders submitted hers\\nwas by far the most expensive but I understand that her plans include a\\nchromium-plated wall on the south side of the village...\"\\n\\n\"...and two breakfasts,\" prompted Winnie.\\n\\n\"...and two breakfasts for the men engaged on the work. Those in favour\\nof the motion will make a clucking sound in imitation of hens, those\\nagainst will say bow-wow.\"\\n\\n\"A most improper proceeding,\" said Reggie. \"What will the servants\\nthink?\"\\n\\n\"We have got to do something until Brenda has been told.\"\\n\\n\"...Me? I\\'m all right.\"\\n\\n\"Then I take it the motion is carried.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I _am_ glad Mrs Beaver got the job,\" said Brenda. \"You see I\\'m in\\nlove with John Beaver, I\\'m in love with John Beaver, I\\'m in love with\\nJohn Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"Is that the decision of the committee?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she is in love with John Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"Then that is carried unanimously.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Winnie. \"He ate two breakfasts.\"\\n\\n\"...by an overwhelming majority.\"\\n\\n\"Why are you all changing your clothes?\" asked Tony, for they were\\nputting on hunting coats.\\n\\n\"For the lawn meet. Hounds are meeting here to-day.\"\\n\\n\"But you can\\'t hunt in summer.\"\\n\\n\"Time is different in Brazil and there is no bathing.\"\\n\\n\"I saw a fox yesterday in Bruton Wood. A mechanical green fox with a\\nbell inside him that jingled as he ran. It frightened them so much that\\nthey ran away and the whole beach was deserted and there was no bathing\\nexcept for Beaver. He can bathe every day, for the time is different in\\nBrazil.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m in love with John Beaver,\" said Ambrose.\\n\\n\"Why, I didn\\'t know you were here.\"\\n\\n\"I came to remind you that you were ill, sir. You must on no account\\nleave your hammock.\"\\n\\n\"But how can I reach the City if I stay here?\"\\n\\n\"I will serve it directly, sir, in the library.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, in the library. There is no point in using the dining-hall now\\nthat her Ladyship has gone to live in Brazil.\"\\n\\n\"I will send the order to the stables, sir.\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want the pony. I told Ben to sell her.\"\\n\\n\"You will have to ride to the smoking-room, sir. Dr Messinger has taken\\nthe canoe.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Ambrose.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\\n\\nThe committee had moved off down the avenue; all except Colonel Inch who\\nhad taken the other drive and was trotting towards Compton Last. Tony\\nand Mrs Rattery were all alone.\\n\\n\"Bow-wow,\" she said, scooping in the cards. \"That carries the motion.\"\\n\\nLooking up from the card table, Tony saw beyond the trees the ramparts\\nand battlement of the City; it was quite near him. From the turret of\\nthe gatehouse a heraldic banner floated in the tropic breeze. He\\nstruggled into an upright position and threw aside his blankets. He was\\nstronger and steadier when the fever was on him. He picked his way\\nthrough the surrounding thorn-scrub; the sound of music rose from the\\nglittering walls; some procession or pageant was passing along them. He\\nlurched into three trunks and became caught up in roots and hanging\\ntendrils of bush-vine; but he pressed forward, unconscious of pain and\\nfatigue.\\n\\nAt last he came into the open. The gates were before him and trumpets\\nwere sounding along the walls, saluting his arrival; from bastion to\\nbastion the message ran to the four points of the compass; petals of\\nalmond and apple blossom were in the air; they carpeted the way, as,\\nafter a summer storm, they lay in the orchards at Hetton. Gilded cupolas\\nand spires of alabaster shone in the sunlight.\\n\\nAmbrose announced, \"The City is served.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\nDU C?T? DE CHEZ TODD\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr Todd had lived in Amazonas for nearly six years, no\\none except a few families of Pie-wie Indians was aware of his existence.\\nHis house stood in a small savannah, one of those little patches of sand\\nand grass that crop up occasionally in that neighbourhood, three miles\\nor so across, bounded on all sides by forest.\\n\\nThe stream which watered it was not marked on any map; it ran through\\nrapids, always dangerous and at most seasons of the year impassable, to\\njoin the upper waters of the river where Dr Messinger had come to grief.\\nNone of the inhabitants of the district, except Mr Todd, had ever heard\\nof the governments of Brazil or Dutch Guiana, both of which from time to\\ntime claimed its possession.\\n\\nMr Todd\\'s house was larger than those of his neighbours, but similar in\\ncharacter--a palm thatch roof, breast-high walls of mud and wattle, and\\na mud floor. He owned the dozen or so head of puny cattle which grazed\\nin the savannah, a plantation of cassava, some banana and mango trees, a\\ndog and, unique in the neighbourhood, a single-barrelled, breech-loading\\nshot-gun. The few commodities which he employed from the outside world\\ncame to him through a long succession of traders, passed from hand to\\nhand, bartered for in a dozen languages at the extreme end of one of the\\nlongest threads in the web of commerce that spreads from Man?os into the\\nremote fastness of the forest.\\n\\nOne day while Mr Todd was engaged in filling some cartridges, a Pie-wie\\ncame to him with the news that a white man was approaching through the\\nforest, alone and very sick. He closed the cartridge and loaded his gun\\nwith it, put those that were finished into his pocket and set out in the\\ndirection indicated.\\n\\nThe man was already clear of the bush when Mr Todd reached him, sitting\\non the ground, clearly in a very bad way. He was without hat or boots,\\nand his clothes were so torn that it was only by the dampness of his\\nbody that they adhered to it; his feet were cut and grossly swollen;\\nevery exposed surface of skin was scarred by insect and bat bites; his\\neyes were wild with fever. He was talking to himself in delirium but\\nstopped when Todd approached and addressed him in English.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the first person who\\'s spoken to me for days,\" said Tony. \"The\\nothers won\\'t stop. They keep bicycling by... I\\'m tired... Brenda was\\nwith me at first but she was frightened by a mechanical mouse, so she\\ntook the canoe and went off. She said she would come back that evening\\nbut she didn\\'t. I expect she\\'s staying with one of her new friends in\\nBrazil... You haven\\'t seen her, have you?\"\\n\\n\"You are the first stranger I have seen for a very long time.\"\\n\\n\"She was wearing a top hat when she left. You can\\'t miss her.\" Then he\\nbegan talking to someone at Mr Todd\\'s side, who was not there.\\n\\n\"Do you see that house over there? Do you think you can manage to walk\\nto it? If not, I can send some Indians to carry you.\"\\n\\nTony squinted across the savannah at Mr Todd\\'s hut.\\n\\n\"Architecture harmonizing with local character,\" he said, \"indigenous\\nmaterial employed throughout. Don\\'t let Mrs Beaver see it or she will\\ncover it with chromium plating.\"\\n\\n\"Try and walk.\" Mr Todd hoisted Tony to his feet and supported him with\\na stout arm.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll ride your bicycle. It _was_ you I passed just now on a bicycle,\\nwasn\\'t it?... except that your beard is a different colour. His was\\ngreen... green as mice.\"\\n\\nMr Todd led Tony across the hummocks of grass towards the house.\\n\\n\"It is a very short way. When we get there I will give you something to\\nmake you better.\"\\n\\n\"Very kind of you... rotten thing for a man to have his wife go away in\\na canoe. That was a long time ago. Nothing to eat since.\" Presently he\\nsaid, \"I say, you\\'re English. I\\'m English too. My name is Last.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mr Last, you aren\\'t to bother about anything more. You\\'re ill and\\nyou\\'ve had a rough journey. I\\'ll take care of you.\"\\n\\nTony looked round him. \"Are you all English?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, all of us.\"\\n\\n\"That dark girl married a Moor... It\\'s very lucky I met you all. I\\nsuppose you\\'re some kind of cycling club?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I feel too tired for bicycling... never liked it much...\\nyou fellows ought to get motor bicycles, you know, much faster and\\nnoisier... Let\\'s stop here.\"\\n\\n\"No, you must come as far as the house. It\\'s not very much farther.\"\\n\\n\"All right... I suppose you would have some difficulty getting petrol\\nhere.\"\\n\\nThey went very slowly, but at length reached the house.\\n\\n\"Lie there in the hammock.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what Messinger said. He\\'s in love with John Beaver.\"\\n\\n\"I will get something for you.\"\\n\\n\"Very good of you. Just my usual morning tray--coffee, toast, fruit. And\\nthe morning papers. If her Ladyship has been called I will have it with\\nher...\"\\n\\nMr Todd went into the back room of the house and dragged a tin canister\\nfrom under a heap of skins. It was full of a mixture of dried leaf and\\nbark. He took a handful and went outside to the fire. When he returned\\nhis guest was bolt upright astride the hammock, talking angrily.\\n\\n\"...You would hear better and it would be more polite if you stood\\nstill when I addressed you instead of walking round in a circle. It is\\nfor your own good that I am telling you... I know you are friends of my\\nwife and that is why you will not listen to me. But be careful. She will\\nsay nothing cruel, she will not raise her voice, there will be no hard\\nwords. She hopes you will be great friends afterwards as before. But she\\nwill leave you. She will go away quietly during the night. She will take\\nher hammock and her rations of farine... Listen to me. I know I am not\\nclever but that is no reason why we should forget all courtesy. Let us\\nkill in the gentlest manner. I will tell you what I have learned in the\\nforest, where time is different. There is no City. Mrs Beaver has\\ncovered it with chromium plating and converted it into flats. Three\\nguineas a week, each with a separate bathroom. Very suitable for base\\nlove. And Polly will be there. She and Mrs Beaver under the fallen\\nbattlements...\"\\n\\nMr Todd put a hand behind Tony\\'s head and held up the concoction of\\nherbs in the calabash. Tony sipped and turned away his head.\\n\\n\"Nasty medicine,\" he said, and began to cry.\\n\\nMr Todd stood by him holding the calabash. Presently Tony drank some\\nmore, screwing up his face and shuddering slightly at the bitterness. Mr\\nTodd stood beside him until the draught was finished; then he threw out\\nthe dregs on to the mud floor. Tony lay back in the hammock sobbing\\nquietly. Soon he fell into a deep sleep.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTony\\'s recovery was slow. At first, days of lucidity alternated with\\ndelirium; then his temperature dropped and he was conscious even when\\nmost ill. The days of fever grew less frequent, finally occurring in the\\nnormal system of the tropics, between long periods of comparative\\nhealth. Mr Todd dosed him regularly with herbal remedies.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very nasty,\" said Tony, \"but it does do good.\"\\n\\n\"There is medicine for everything in the forest,\" said Mr Todd; \"to make\\nyou well and to make you ill. My mother was an Indian and she taught me\\nmany of them. I have learned others from time to time from my wives.\\nThere are plants to cure you and give you fever, to kill you and send\\nyou mad, to keep away snakes, to intoxicate fish so that you can pick\\nthem out of the water with your hands like fruit from a tree. There are\\nmedicines even I do not know. They say that it is possible to bring dead\\npeople to life after they have begun to stink, but I have not seen it\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"But surely you are English?\"\\n\\n\"My father was--at least a Barbadian. He came to Guiana as a missionary.\\nHe was married to a white woman but he left her in Guiana to look for\\ngold. Then he took my mother. The Pie-wie women are ugly but very\\ndevoted. I have had many. Most of the men and women living in this\\nsavannah are my children. That is why they obey--for that reason and\\nbecause I have the gun. My father lived to a great age. It is not twenty\\nyears since he died. He was a man of education. Can you read?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, of course.\"\\n\\n\"It is not everyone who is so fortunate. I cannot.\"\\n\\nTony laughed apologetically. \"But I suppose you haven\\'t much opportunity\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, that is just it. I have a _great_ many books. I will show you\\nwhen you are better. Until five years ago there was an Englishman--at\\nleast a black man, but he was well educated in Georgetown. He died. He\\nused to read to me every day until he died. You shall read to me when\\nyou are better.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be delighted to.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you shall read to me,\" Mr Todd repeated, nodding over the\\ncalabash.\\n\\nDuring the early days of his convalescence Tony had little conversation\\nwith his host, he lay in the hammock staring up at the thatched roof and\\nthinking about Brenda. The days, exactly twelve hours each, passed\\nwithout distinction. Mr Todd retired to sleep at sundown, leaving a\\nlittle lamp burning--a handwoven wick drooping from a pot of beef\\nfat--to keep away vampire bats.\\n\\nThe first time that Tony left the house Mr Todd took him for a little\\nstroll around the farm.\\n\\n\"I will show you the black man\\'s grave,\" he said, leading him to a mound\\nbetween the mango trees. \"He was very kind. Every afternoon until he\\ndied, for two hours, he used to read to me. I think I will put up a\\ncross--to commemorate his death and your arrival--a pretty idea. Do you\\nbelieve in God?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so. I\\'ve never really thought about it much.\"\\n\\n\"I have thought about it a _great_ deal and I still do not know...\\nDickens did.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, it is apparent in all his books. You will see.\"\\n\\nThat afternoon Mr Todd began the construction of a headpiece for the\\nNegro\\'s grave. He worked with a large spoke-shave in a wood so hard that\\nit grated and rang like metal.\\n\\nAt last, when Tony had passed six or seven consecutive nights without\\nfever, Mr Todd said, \"Now I think you are well enough to see the books.\"\\n\\nAt one end of the hut there was a kind of loft formed by a rough\\nplatform erected in the eaves of the roof. Mr Todd propped a ladder\\nagainst it and mounted. Tony followed, still unsteady after his illness.\\nMr Todd sat on the platform and Tony stood at the top of the ladder\\nlooking over. There was a heap of bundles there, tied up with rag, palm\\nleaf and raw hide.\\n\\n\"It has been hard to keep out the worms and ants. Two are practically\\ndestroyed. But there is an oil the Indians make that is useful.\"\\n\\nHe unwrapped the nearest parcel and handed down a calf-bound book. It\\nwas an early American edition of _Bleak House_.\\n\\n\"It does not matter which we take first.\"\\n\\n\"You are fond of Dickens?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, of course. More than fond, far more. You see, they are the\\nonly books I have ever heard. My father used to read them and then later\\nthe black man... and now you. I have heard them all several times by\\nnow but I never get tired; there is always more to be learned and\\nnoticed, so many characters, so many changes of scene, so many words...\\nI have all Dickens\\'s books here except those that the ants devoured. It\\ntakes a long time to read them all--more than two years.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Tony lightly, \"they will well last out my visit.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I hope not. It is delightful to start again. Each time I think I\\nfind more to enjoy and admire.\"\\n\\nThey took down the first volume of _Bleak House_ and that afternoon Tony\\nhad his first reading.\\n\\nHe had always rather enjoyed reading aloud and in the first year of\\nmarriage had shared several books in this way with Brenda, until one\\nday, in a moment of frankness, she remarked that it was torture to her.\\nHe had read to John Andrew, late in the afternoon, in winter, while the\\nchild sat before the nursery fender eating his supper. But Mr Todd was a\\nunique audience.\\n\\nThe old man sat astride his hammock opposite Tony, fixing him throughout\\nwith his eyes, and following the words, soundlessly, with his lips.\\nOften when a new character was introduced he would say, \"Repeat the\\nname, I have forgotten him,\" or \"Yes, yes, I remember her well. She\\ndies, poor woman.\" He would frequently interrupt with questions; not as\\nTony would have imagined about the circumstances of the story--such\\nthings as the procedure of the Lord Chancellor\\'s Court or the social\\nconventions of the time, though they must have been unintelligible, did\\nnot concern him--but always about the characters. \"Now, why does she say\\nthat? Does she really mean it? Did she feel faint because of the heat of\\nthe fire or of something in that paper?\" He laughed loudly at all the\\njokes and at some passages which did not seem humorous to Tony, asking\\nhim to repeat them two or three times, and later at the description of\\nthe sufferings of the outcasts in \"Tom-all-alone\\'s\" tears ran down his\\ncheeks into his beard. His comments on the story were usually simple. \"I\\nthink the Dedlock is a very proud man,\" or, \"Mrs Jellyby does not take\\nenough care of her children.\"\\n\\nTony enjoyed the readings almost as much as he did.\\n\\nAt the end of the first day the old man said, \"You read beautifully,\\nwith a far better accent than the black man. And you explain better. It\\nis almost as though my father were here again.\" And always at the end of\\na session he thanked his guest courteously. \"I enjoyed that _very_ much.\\nIt was an extremely distressing chapter. But, if I remember it rightly,\\nit will all turn out well.\"\\n\\nBy the time that they were in the second volume, however, the novelty of\\nthe old man\\'s delight had begun to wane, and Tony was feeling strong\\nenough to be restless. He touched more than once on the subject of his\\ndeparture, asking about canoes and rains and the possibility of finding\\nguides. But Mr Todd seemed obtuse and paid no attention to these hints.\\n\\nOne day, running his thumb through the pages of _Bleak House_ that\\nremained to be read, Tony said, \"We still have a lot to get through. I\\nhope I shall be able to finish it before I go.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mr Todd. \"Do not disturb yourself about that. You will\\nhave time to finish it, my friend.\"\\n\\nFor the first time Tony noticed something slightly menacing in his\\nhost\\'s manner. That evening at supper, a brief meal of farine and dried\\nbeef, eaten just before sundown, Tony renewed the subject.\\n\\n\"You know, Mr Todd, the time has come when I must be thinking about\\ngetting back to civilization. I have already imposed myself on your\\nhospitality far too long.\"\\n\\nMr Todd bent over the plate, crunching mouthfuls of farine, but made no\\nreply.\\n\\n\"How soon do you think I shall be able to get a boat?... I said, how\\nsoon do you think I shall be able to get a boat? I appreciate all your\\nkindness to me more than I can say, but...\"\\n\\n\"My friend, any kindness I may have shown is amply repaid by your\\nreading of Dickens. Do not let us mention the subject again.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m very glad you have enjoyed it. I have, too. But I really must\\nbe thinking of getting back...\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr Todd. \"The black man was like that. He thought of it all\\nthe time. But he died here...\"\\n\\nTwice during the next day Tony opened the subject, but his host was\\nevasive. Finally, he said, \"Forgive me, Mr Todd, but I really must press\\nthe point. When can I get a boat?\"\\n\\n\"There is no boat.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the Indians can build one.\"\\n\\n\"You must wait for the rains. There is not enough water in the river\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"How long will that be?\"\\n\\n\"A month... two months...\"\\n\\nThey had finished _Bleak House_ and were nearing the end of _Dombey and\\nSon_ when the rain came.\\n\\n\"Now it is time to make preparations to go.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that is impossible. The Indians will not make a boat during the\\nrainy season--it is one of their superstitions.\"\\n\\n\"You might have told me.\"\\n\\n\"Did I not mention it? I forgot.\"\\n\\nNext morning Tony went out alone while his host was busy, and, looking\\nas aimless as he could, strolled across the savannah to the group of\\nIndian houses. There were four or five Pie-wies sitting in one of the\\ndoorways. They did not look up as he approached them. He addressed them\\nin the few words of Macushi he had acquired during the journey but they\\nmade no sign whether they understood him or not. Then he drew a sketch\\nof a canoe in the sand, he went through some vague motions of carpentry,\\npointed from them to him, then made motions of giving something to them\\nand scratched out the outlines of a gun and a hat and a few other\\nrecognizable articles of trade. One of the women giggled but no one gave\\nany sign of comprehension, and he went away unsatisfied.\\n\\nAt their mid-day meal Mr Todd said, \"Mr Last, the Indians tell me that\\nyou have been trying to speak with them. It is easier that you say\\nanything you wish through me. You realize, do you not, that they would\\ndo nothing without my authority. They regard themselves, quite rightly\\nin many cases, as my children.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I was asking them about a canoe.\"\\n\\n\"So they gave me to understand... and now if you have finished your\\nmeal perhaps we might have another chapter. I am quite absorbed in the\\nbook.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThey finished _Dombey and Son_. Nearly a year had passed since Tony had\\nleft England, and his gloomy foreboding of permanent exile became\\nsuddenly acute when, between the pages of _Martin Chuzzlewit_, he found\\na document written in pencil in irregular characters.\\n\\n    Year 1919.\\n\\n    I James Todd of Brazil do swear to Barnabas Washington of\\n    Georgetown that if he finish this book in fact Martin Chuzzlewit\\n    I will let him go away back as soon as finished.\\n\\nThere followed a heavy pencil X and after it: _Mr Todd made this mark\\nsigned Barnabas Washington_.\\n\\n\"Mr Todd,\" said Tony, \"I must speak frankly. You saved my life, and when\\nI get back to civilization I will reward you to the best of my ability.\\nI will give you anything within reason. But at present you are keeping\\nme here against my will. I demand to be released.\"\\n\\n\"But, my friend, what is keeping you? You are under no restraint. Go\\nwhen you like.\"\\n\\n\"You know very well that I can\\'t get away without your help.\"\\n\\n\"In that case you must humour an old man. Read me another chapter.\"\\n\\n\"Mr Todd, I swear by anything you like that when I get to Man?os I will\\nfind someone to take my place. I will pay a man to read to you all day.\"\\n\\n\"But I have no need of another man. You read so well.\"\\n\\n\"I have read for the last time.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" said Mr Todd politely.\\n\\nThat evening at supper only one plate of dried meat and farine was\\nbrought in and Mr Todd ate alone. Tony lay without speaking, staring at\\nthe thatch.\\n\\nNext day at noon a single plate was put before Mr Todd but with it lay\\nhis gun, cocked, on his knee, as he ate. Tony resumed the reading of\\n_Martin Chuzzlewit_ where it had been interrupted.\\n\\nWeeks passed hopelessly. They read _Nicholas Nickleby_ and _Little\\nDorrit_ and _Oliver Twist_. Then a stranger arrived in the savannah, a\\nhalf-caste prospector, one of that lonely order of men who wander for a\\nlifetime through the forests, tracing the little streams, sifting the\\ngravel and, ounce by ounce, filling the little leather sack of gold\\ndust, more often than not dying of exposure and starvation with five\\nhundred dollars worth of gold hung round their necks. Mr Todd was vexed\\nat his arrival, gave him farine and _tasso_ and sent him on his journey\\nwithin an hour of his arrival, but in that hour Tony had time to\\nscribble his name on a slip of paper and put it into the man\\'s hand.\\n\\nFrom now on there was hope. The days followed their unvarying routine;\\ncoffee at sunrise, a morning of inaction while Mr Todd pottered about on\\nthe business of the farm, farine and _tasso_ at noon, Dickens in the\\nafternoon, farine and _tasso_ and sometimes some fruit for supper,\\nsilence from sunset to dawn with the small wick glowing in the beef fat\\nand the palm thatch overhead dimly discernible; but Tony lived in quiet\\nconfidence and expectation.\\n\\nSometime, this year or the next, the prospector would arrive at a\\nBrazilian village with news of his discovery. The disasters of the\\nMessinger expedition would not have passed unnoticed. Tony could imagine\\nthe headlines that must have appeared in the popular press; even now,\\nprobably, there were search parties working over the country he had\\ncrossed; any day English voices must sound over the savannah and a dozen\\nfriendly adventurers come crashing through the bush. Even as he was\\nreading, while his lips mechanically followed the printed pages, his\\nmind wandered away from his eager, crazy host opposite, and he began to\\nnarrate to himself incidents of his homecoming--the gradual\\nre-encounters with civilization (he shaved and bought new clothes at\\nMan?os, telegraphed for money, received wires of congratulation; he\\nenjoyed the leisurely river journey to Belem, the big liner to Europe;\\nsavoured good claret and fresh meat and spring vegetables; he was shy at\\nmeeting Brenda and uncertain how to address her... \"_Darling_, you\\'ve\\nbeen much longer than you said. I quite thought you were lost...\").\\n\\nAnd then Mr Todd interrupted. \"May I trouble you to read that passage\\nagain? It is one I particularly enjoy.\"\\n\\nThe weeks passed; there was no sign of rescue but Tony endured the day\\nfor hope of what might happen on the morrow; he even felt a slight\\nstirring of cordiality towards his jailer and was therefore quite\\nwilling to join him when, one evening after a long conference with an\\nIndian neighbour he proposed a celebration.\\n\\n\"It is one of the local feast days,\" he explained, \"and they have been\\nmaking _pivari_. You may not like it but you should try some. We will go\\nacross to this man\\'s home to-night.\"\\n\\nAccordingly after supper they joined a party of Indians that were\\nassembled round the fire in one of the huts at the other side of the\\nsavannah. They were singing in an apathetic, monotonous manner and\\npassing a large calabash of liquid from mouth to mouth. Separate bowls\\nwere brought for Tony and Mr Todd, and they were given hammocks to sit\\nin.\\n\\n\"You must drink it all without lowering the cup. That is the etiquette.\"\\n\\nTony gulped the dark liquid, trying not to taste it. But it was not\\nunpleasant, hard and muddy on the palate like most of the beverages he\\nhad been offered in Brazil, but with a flavour of honey and brown bread.\\nHe leant back in the hammock feeling unusually contented. Perhaps at\\nthat very moment the search party was in camp a few hours\" journey from\\nthem. Meanwhile he was warm and drowsy. The cadence of song rose and\\nfell interminably, liturgically. Another calabash of _pivari_ was\\noffered him and he handed it back empty. He lay full length watching the\\nplay of shadows on the thatch as the Pie-wies began to dance. Then he\\nshut his eyes and thought of England and Hetton and fell asleep.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nHe awoke, still in the Indian hut, with the impression that he had\\noutslept his usual hour. By the position of the sun he knew it was late\\nafternoon. No one else was about. He looked for his watch and found to\\nhis surprise that it was not on his wrist. He had left it in the house,\\nhe supposed, before coming to the party.\\n\\n\"I must have been tight last night,\" he reflected. Treacherous drink\\nthat.\" He had a headache and feared a recurrence of fever. He found when\\nhe set his feet to the ground that he stood with difficulty; his walk\\nwas unsteady and his mind confused as it had been during the first weeks\\nof his convalescence. On his way across the savannah he was obliged to\\nstop more than once, shutting his eyes and breathing deeply. When he\\nreached the house he found Mr Todd sitting there.\\n\\n\"Ah, my friend, you are late for the reading this afternoon. There is\\nscarcely another half hour of light. How do you feel?\"\\n\\n\"Rotten. That drink doesn\\'t seem to agree with me.\"\\n\\n\"I will give you something to make you better. The forest has remedies\\nfor everything; to make you awake and to make you sleep.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t seen my watch anywhere?\"\\n\\n\"You have missed it?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I thought I was wearing it. I say, I\\'ve never slept so long.\"\\n\\n\"Not since you were a baby. Do you know how long? Two days.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense. I can\\'t have.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed. It is a long time. It is a pity because you missed our\\nguests.\"\\n\\n\"Guests?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes. I have been quite gay while you were asleep. Three men from\\noutside. Englishmen. It is a pity you missed them. A pity for them, too,\\nas they particularly wished to see you. But what could I do? You were so\\nsound asleep. They had come all the way to find you, so--I thought you\\nwould not mind--as you could not greet them yourself, I gave them a\\nlittle souvenir, your watch. They wanted something to take back to\\nEngland where a reward is being offered for news of you. They were very\\npleased with it. And they took some photographs of the little cross I\\nput up to commemorate your coming. They were pleased with that, too.\\nThey were very easily pleased. But I do not suppose they will visit us\\nagain, our life here is so retired... no pleasures except reading... I\\ndo not suppose we shall ever have visitors again... well, well, I will\\nget you some medicine to make you feel better. Your head aches, does it\\nnot?... We will not have any Dickens to-day... but to-morrow, and the\\nday after that, and the day after that. Let us read _Little Dorrit_\\nagain. There are passages in that book I can never hear without the\\ntemptation to weep.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\nENGLISH GOTHIC--III\\n\\n\\nA light breeze in the dewy orchards; brilliant, cool sunshine over\\nmeadows and copses; the elms were all in bud in the avenue; everything\\nwas early that year, for it had been a mild winter.\\n\\nHigh overhead among its gargoyles and crockets the clock chimed for the\\nhour and solemnly struck fourteen. It was half-past eight. The clock has\\nbeen irregular lately. It was one of the things that Richard Last\\nintended to see to, when death duties were paid and silver foxes began\\nto show a profit.\\n\\nMolly Last bowled up the drive on her two-stroke motor-cycle; there was\\nbran mash on her breeches and in her hair. She had been feeding the\\nAngora rabbits.\\n\\nOn the gravel in front of the house the new memorial stood, shrouded in\\na flag. Molly propped the motor-cycle against the wall of the drawbridge\\nand ran in to breakfast.\\n\\nLife at Hetton was busier but simpler since Richard Last\\'s succession.\\nAmbrose remained, but there were no longer any footmen; he and a boy and\\nfour women servants did the work of the house. Richard Last called them\\nhis \"skeleton staff\". When things were easier he would extend the\\nhousehold; meanwhile the dining-hall and the library were added to the\\nstate apartments which were kept locked and shuttered; the family lived\\nin the morning-room, the smoking-room and what had been Tony\\'s study.\\nMost of the kitchen quarters, too, were out of use; an up-to-date and\\neconomical range had been installed in one of the pantries.\\n\\nThe family all appeared downstairs by half-past eight, except Agnes, who\\ntook longer to dress and was usually some minutes late; Teddy and Molly\\nhad been out for an hour, she among the rabbits, he to the silver foxes.\\nTeddy was twenty-two and lived at home. Peter was still at Oxford.\\n\\nThey breakfasted together in the morning-room. Mrs Last sat at one end\\nof the table, her husband at the other; there was a constant traffic\\nfrom hand to hand to and fro between them of cups, plates, honey-jars\\nand correspondence.\\n\\nMrs Last said, \"Molly, you have rabbit-feed on your head again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh well, I shall have to tidy up anyway before the jamboree.\"\\n\\nMr Last said, \"_Jamboree?_ Is nothing sacred to you children?\"\\n\\nTeddy said, \"Another casualty at the stinkeries. That little vixen we\\nbought from the people at Okehampton got her brush bitten off during the\\nnight. Must have got it through the wire into the next cage. Tricky\\nbirds, foxes.\"\\n\\nAgnes came next; she was a neat, circumspect child of twelve, with large\\ngrave eyes behind her goggles. She kissed her father and mother and\\nsaid, \"I\\'m sorry if I\\'m late.\"\\n\\n\"_If_ you\\'re late...\" said Mr Last tolerantly.\\n\\n\"How long will the show last?\" asked Teddy. \"I\\'ve got to run over to\\nBayton and get some more rabbits for the foxes. Chivers says he\\'s got\\nabout fifty waiting for me. We can\\'t shoot enough here. Greedy little\\nbeggars.\"\\n\\n\"It will be all over by half-past eleven. Mr Tendril isn\\'t going to\\npreach a sermon. It\\'s just as well really. He\\'s got it into his head\\nthat Cousin Tony died in Afghanistan.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a letter here from Cousin Brenda. She\\'s very sorry but she\\ncan\\'t get down here for the dedication.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\nThere was a general silence.\\n\\n\"She says that Jock has a three-line whip for this afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\\n\"She could have come without him,\" said Molly.\\n\\n\"She sends her love to us all and to Hetton.\"\\n\\nThere was another pause.\\n\\n\"Well, I think it\\'s a jolly good thing,\" said Molly. \"She couldn\\'t show\\nmuch widowly grief. It didn\\'t take her long to get hitched up again.\"\\n\\n\"_Molly!_\"\\n\\n\"And you know you think the same.\"\\n\\n\"I will not allow you to talk like that about Cousin Brenda, whatever we\\nthink. She had a perfect right to marry again and I hope she and Mr\\nGrant-Menzies are very happy.\"\\n\\n\"She was always jolly decent to us when she used to live here,\" said\\nAgnes.\\n\\n\"Well, I should hope so,\" said Teddy. \"After all, it\\'s our place.\"\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nThe day was still fine at eleven o\\'clock, though the wind had got up,\\nfluttering the papers on which the order of the service was printed and\\nonce threatening to unveil the memorial prematurely. Several relatives\\nwere present, Lady St Cloud, Aunt Frances and the family of impoverished\\nLasts who had not profited by Tony\\'s disappearance. All the household\\nand estate servants were there, several tenants and most of the village;\\nthere were also a dozen or so neighbours, among them Colonel\\nInch--Richard Last and Teddy had hunted regularly that season with the\\nPigstanton. Mr Tendril conducted the brief service in resonant tones\\nthat were clearly audible above the blustering wind. When he pulled the\\ncord the flag fell away from the memorial without mishap.\\n\\nIt was a plain monolith of local stone, inscribed:\\n\\n                         ANTHONY LAST OF HETTON\\n                                EXPLORER\\n                          Born at Hetton, 1902\\n                          Died in Brazil, 1934\\n\\nWhen the local visitors had left and the relatives had gone into the\\nhouse to be shown the new labour-saving arrangements, Richard Last and\\nLady St Cloud remained for a short time on the gravel.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad we put that up,\" he said. \"You know, I should never have\\nthought of it, if it had not been for a Mrs Beaver. She wrote to me as\\nsoon as the news of Tony\\'s death was published. I didn\\'t know her at the\\ntime. Of course we knew very few of Tony\\'s friends.\"\\n\\n\"It was her suggestion?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she said that as one of Tony\\'s closest friends she knew he would\\nwish to have some monument at Hetton. She was most considerate--even\\noffering to arrange with the contractors for it. Her own plans were more\\nambitious. She proposed that we should have the chapel redecorated as a\\nchantry. But I think this is what he would have preferred. The stone\\ncomes from one of our own quarries and was cut by the estate workmen.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I think he would have preferred this,\" said Lady St Cloud.\\n\\n                 *        *        *        *        *\\n\\nTeddy had chosen Galahad for his bedroom. He disengaged himself from the\\nfamily and hurried up to change out of his dark clothes. Within ten\\nminutes he was in his car driving to Chivers\\' farm. Before luncheon he\\nwas back with the rabbits. They were skinned and tied round the feet\\ninto bundles of four.\\n\\n\"Coming to the stinkeries?\" he asked Agnes.\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m looking after Cousin Frances. She got rather on mother\\'s nerves\\nthrough crabbing the new boiler.\"\\n\\nThe silver-fox farm was behind the stables; a long double row of wire\\ncages; they had wire floors covered with earth and cinders to prevent\\nthe animals digging their way out. They lived in pairs; some were\\nmoderately tame but it was unwise to rely upon them. Teddy and Ben\\nHacket--who helped with them--had been badly bitten more than once that\\nwinter.\\n\\nThey ran up to the doors when they saw Teddy come with the rabbits. The\\nvixen who had lost her brush seemed little the worse for her accident.\\n\\nTeddy surveyed his charges with pride and affection. It was by means of\\nthem that he hoped one day to restore Hetton to the glory that it had\\nenjoyed in the days of his Cousin Tony.'"
